Footnote 1, page 1, says that the C Standard comes with a Rationale; it doesn't.

### Response

The footnote actually states, in part, “It is accompanied by a Rationale
document that explains ...” And indeed, the C Standard was accompanied by such a
document throughout its approval process. ISO, unfortunately, has elected not to
distribute the Rationale with the C Standard. “Accompanied by” does not promise
“comes with” when you buy the C Standard.
