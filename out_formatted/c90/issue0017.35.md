When is a physical source line created?

Is the output or input to translation phase 1 a physical source line?

Comment from WG14 on 1997-09-23:

### Response

The use of the term “physical source line” occurs only in the description of the
phases of translation (subclause 5.1.1.2) and the question of whether the input
or output of phase 1 consists of physical source lines does not matter.
