<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have discovered several issues in 6.8p4, which defines “full expression” and
points out the major implications for an expression that is a full expression.
In this paper I present the issues, along with my recommendations. For the
issues for which it makes sense, I will later submit defect reports.</p>
<p>Here is the text of 6.8p4, with clause numbering added for convenience of
reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A <em>full expression</em> is an expression that is not part of another expression or of a declarator.</li>
<li>Each of the following is a full expression:
<ol>
<li>an initializer that is not part of a compound literal;</li>
<li>the expression in an expression statement;</li>
<li>the controlling expression of a selection statement (if or switch);</li>
<li>the controlling expression of a while or do statement;</li>
<li>each of the (optional) expressions of a for statement;</li>
<li>the (optional) expression in a return statement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There is a sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression and the evaluation of the next full expression to be evaluated.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are the issues.</p>
<p>A. The phrase “not part of another expression or of a declarator” (sentence 1)
is rather difficult to understand. It <em>probably</em> means: not part of another
expression, nor part of a declarator. (But DeMorgan's law is hard on the brain.)</p>
<p>I believe this could be fixed as a simple editorial issue.</p>
<p>B. The status of an initializer expression depends on whether the context is a
declaration or a compound literal (clause 2.1). That would seem to imply
different sequencing guarantees in those contexts. As it turns out, it does, but
the implication is quite subtle. Consider 6.7.9p23:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evaluations of the initialization list expressions are indeterminately
sequenced with respect to one another and thus the order in which any side
effects occur is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And consider this example:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#include</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

}
</pre></div>

<p>In every use of the <code>INITIALIZERS</code> macro, the variable <code>i</code> is incremented three
times. In cases 1 and 2, there is no undefined behavior, because the increments
are in expressions that are indeterminately sequenced with respect to one
another, not unsequenced. There is no guarantee in what order the evaluations
are done, so there is no guarantee in what order they will appear, but the
initial values are guaranteed to be <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code> and <code>'2'</code>.</p>
<p>(It's not perfectly clear whether that guarantee was provided by C99, which
instead said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The order in which any side effects occur among the initialization list
expressions is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any event, as a data point, that guarantee was not honored by GCC until
release 4.6, in 2011.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, because case 3 contains an unsequenced evaluation of <code>i</code> in
the same full expression, it has undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Considering the number of hours it took me to finally reach this conclusion, I
thought it would be worthwhile to bring it to the full committee to make sure
everyone understands and agrees with it. If so, an addition to the rationale
might be in order.</p>
<p>C. Consider 6.7.6p3 (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>full declarator</em> is a declarator that is not part of another declarator.
<strong>The end of a full declarator is a sequence point.</strong> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also 6.2.4p8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A non-lvalue expression with structure or union type, where the structure or
union contains a member with array type (including, recursively, members of all
contained structures and unions) refers to an object with automatic storage
duration and <em>temporary lifetime</em>.<sup>36)</sup> Its lifetime begins when the
expression is evaluated and its initial value is the value of the expression.
Its lifetime ends <strong>when the evaluation of the containing full expression or
full declarator ends</strong>. Any attempt to modify an object with temporary lifetime
results in undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from these passages that the sequence of evaluations includes not
only full expressions, but also full declarators – whatever sense it makes to
talk about “evaluating” a full declarator. But sentence 3 does not acknowledge
that reality.</p>
<p>My inclination is to adopt a bit of terminology from Ada, and start talking
about the “elaboration” of a declarator, which, for a variably modified type,
involves the run-time evaluation of array sizes, and then to re-draft sentence 3
and the other paragraphs cited here, to make it clear that sequence points
separate elaborations of full declarators as well as evaluations of full
expressions. In any event, I think there's a problem in sentence 3 that needs to
be fixed.</p>
<p>D. Expressions in abstract declarators are not mentioned at all (compare to
sentence 1). The logical inference is that such an expression is not a full
expression by itself, but part of the containing full expression. But there are
cases where there is no containing full expression. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">typedef</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">_Atomic</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #666666">*</span>)[rand()])<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>T;

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">_Alignas</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>[rand()])<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>i;
</pre></div>

<p>In these examples, not only is there no containing full expression, there isn't
even any containing full declarator, because these expressions appear in the
declaration specifiers, not the declarator.</p>
<p>Probably the simplest approach here would be to disallow variably modified types
with <code>_Atomic</code> and <code>_Alignas</code>, at least until the next revision of the standard.</p>
<p>E. The list of full expression contexts (sentence 2) is not logically complete.
According to the definition (sentence 1), an expression appearing in a
constant-expression context is (often) a full expression. Of course there are no
sequencing implications relevant for constant expressions, but it's not clear
that makes it important for a constant expression not to be counted as a full
expression. In any event, it's not clear how the list normatively interacts with
the definition.</p>
<p>I think we should consider moving the list into a note, so it's clear that the
definition is, well, definitive. The note could also point out that sequencing
is irrelevant to constant expressions.</p>

<p>Comment from WG14 on 2017-11-03:</p>
<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>These are subtle issues upon which the committee wishes to continue discussing.</li>
<li>The committee is seeking concurrence with the project editor that Point A may be viewed as editorial.</li>
<li>To Point B the committee is in agreement that there is a "guarantee" of the distinct values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>, and that this is not new to C11. The committee requires further discussion as to whether and how these subtleties could be expressed in a non-normative fashion, such as "in the rationale", "in a footnote", or simply as an example.</li>
<li>To Point C the committee agrees that some change is needed and has solicited a suggested resolution from the author. The fact that VLAs can have several dimensions and hence several expressions gave pause to all.</li>
<li>To Point D the committee agrees that this has been left undefined and deserves a committee response but no normative or other change.</li>
<li>To Point E, the committee agreed that the list of full expressions named in 6.8 paragraph 4 second sentence should likely be regarded as non-normative rather than allowing it to appear exhaustive. To achieve this, the list could be transformed into a note or footnote.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apr 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee solicits the author for any suggested technical corrigenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no paper submitted on this topic, and the committee will again solicit
the author for suggested technical corrigenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apr 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no paper submitted on this topic, and the committee has solicited the
author for suggested technical corrigenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The paper <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1965.htm">N1965</a> was submitted and discussed.</li>
<li>From that, the editorial suggestion from Part A was incorporated into Part C which was approved by the committee as a normative element in the following Proposed Technical Corrigendum, and Part E was approved as a non-normative footnote.</li>
<li>The Part D section had already met with some some skepticism from the committee and was mostly provided as an idea to consider. Discussion revealed that there are some implementations of VLA that would be broken by this change, and so the committee preferred to not try to address this issue from this DR at this time. Another new paper on this point would be welcomed by the committee.</li>
<li>The sequencing issues raise in Part B are subtle and the Standard potentially confusing, but there is no reported evidence that this is causing any issues in practice. The new paper offered no Suggested Technical Corrigendum in this area, and the committee did not request further elaboration of what might be needed in this area, and so was content to accept just the changes resolving issues A, C, and E in the following Proposed Technical Corrigendum.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Change 6.2.4p8 sentence 3 from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its lifetime ends when the evaluation of the containing full expression or full
declarator ends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its lifetime ends when the evaluation of the containing full expression ends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delete 6.7.6p3 sentence 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The end of a full declarator is a sequence point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change 6.8p4 from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>full expression</em> is an expression that is not part of another expression, or
of a declarator. Each of the following is a full expression: an initializer that
is not part of a compound literal; the expression in an expression statement;
the controlling expression of a selection statement (<code>if</code> or <code>switch)</code>; the
controlling expression of a <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> statement; each of the (optional)
expressions of a <code>for</code> statement; the (optional) expression in a <code>return</code>
statement. There is a sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression
and the evaluation of the next full expression to be evaluated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>full expression</em> is an expression that is not part of another expression, nor
part of a declarator or abstract declarator. There is also an implicit full
expression in which the non-constant size expressions for a variably modified
type are evaluated; within that full expression, the evaluation of different
size expressions are unsequenced with respect to one another. There is a
sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression and the evaluation of
the next full expression to be evaluated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add after 6.8p4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Each of the following is a full expression:</p>
<ul>
<li>a full declarator for a variably modified type;</li>
<li>an initializer that is not part of a compound literal;</li>
<li>the expression in an expression statement;</li>
<li>the controlling expression of a selection statement (<code>if</code> or <code>switch)</code>;</li>
<li>the controlling expression of a <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> statement;</li>
<li>each of the (optional) expressions of a <code>for</code> statement;</li>
<li>the (optional) expression in a <code>return</code> statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a constant expression satisfies the definition of a full expression,
evaluating it does not depend on nor produce any side effects, so the sequencing
implications of being a full expression are not relevant to a constant
expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delete the Annex C bullet:</p>
<ul>
<li>The end of a full declarator; declarators (6.7.6);</li>
</ul>
<p>Change the Annex C bullet from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between the evaluation of a full expression and the next full expression to be evaluated. The following are full expressions: an initializer that is not part of a compound literal; the expression in an expression statement; the controlling expression of a selection statement (<code>if</code> or <code>switch)</code>; the controlling expression of a <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> statement; each of the (optional) expressions of a <code>for</code> statement; the (optional) expression in a <code>return</code> statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>to:</p>
<p>Between the evaluation of a full expression and the next full expression to be evaluated. The following are full expressions: a full declarator for a variably modified type; an initializer that is not part of a compound literal; the expression in an expression statement; the controlling expression of a selection statement (<code>if</code> or <code>switch)</code>; the controlling expression of a <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> statement; each of the (optional) expressions of a <code>for</code> statement; the (optional) expression in a <code>return</code> statement.</p>
