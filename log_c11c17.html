<h2>Issue 0400: <code>realloc</code> with size zero problems</h2>
<p>Authors: Austin Group, Nick Stoughton (US)<br />
Date: 2011-10-24<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1559.pdf">N1559</a><br />
Status: Fixed<br />
Fixed in: C17<br />
Converted from: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2396.htm">n2396.htm</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>There are at least three existing <code>realloc</code> behaviors when <code>NULL</code> is returned;
the differences only occur for a size of 0 (for non-zero size, all three
implementations set <code>errno</code> to <code>ENOMEM</code> when returning <code>NULL</code>, even though that
is not required by C99).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AIX</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>realloc(NULL,0)</code> always returns NULL, errno is EINVAL<br />
<code>realloc(ptr,0)</code> always returns NULL, ptr freed, errno is EINVAL</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BSD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>realloc(NULL,0)</code> only gives NULL on alloc failure, errno is ENOMEM<br />
<code>realloc(ptr,0)</code> only gives NULL on alloc failure, ptr unchanged, errno is
ENOMEM</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>glibc</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>realloc(NULL,0)</code> only gives NULL on alloc failure, errno is ENOMEM<br />
<code>realloc(ptr,0)</code> always returns NULL, ptr freed, errno unchanged</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Austin Group raised this matter with WG14 during earlier meetings (most
notably during the London 2011 meeting). The direction from WG14 has led to The
Austin Group aligning the POSIX text more closely to that in C99 and C1x as a
part of TC1.</p>
<p>The behavior now required in POSIX is that implemented by <strong>BSD</strong> above.
However, C99 has a loophole in implementation-defined behavior that still
appears to permit AIX and glibc behaviors. The C1x draft carries the same
wording loophole, so the planned course of action is to raise a defect against
C1x once it completes standardization, where the outcome of that defect will
either be that C1x tightens the wording to eliminate the loophole or relaxes the
wording to align with existing practice. Therefore, the behavior of errno in
Issue 8 should be deferred until after any C1x defect has been resolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is
implementation-defined: either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior is as
if the size were some nonzero value, except that the returned pointer shall not
be used to access an object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An implementation should not be allowed to define the behavior of returning a
null pointer as a successful reallocation; if a null pointer is returned, then
the orignal pointer has not been freed.</p>
<h3>Suggested Change</h3>
<p>At 7.22.3, para 1, change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is
implementation-defined: either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior is as
if the size were some nonzero value, except that the returned pointer shall not
be used to access an object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is
implementation-defined: either a null pointer is returned <ins>and errno set to
indicate the error</ins>, or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero
value, except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add a footnote to this sentence stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><ins><strong>Note</strong> Memory allocated by these functions should be freed via a call to
<code>free</code>, and not by means of a <code>realoc(p, 0)</code>.</ins></p>

<h2>Issue 0403: <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code> in the memory model</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Batty<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The synchronisation afforded to malloc and free is missing some vital ordering,
and as the definition stands it makes little sense and creates cycles in happens
before. C++11 includes a total order over the allocation and deallocation
calls, which fixes the problem and seems to give a sensible semantics. From
18.6.1.4p1 in
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/prot/14882fdis/n3291.pdf">N3291</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calls to these functions that allocate or deallocate a particular unit of
storage shall occur in a single total order, and each such deallocation call
shall happen before the next allocation (if any) in this order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a typo here. Happens before edges are not transitively
closed in to the happens before relation, but the edges here are meant to be.
Instead the sentence above should create a synchronises with edge. In light of
this, we suggest removing the last two sentences from 7.22.3p2 and replacing
them with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calls to these functions that allocate or deallocate a particular region of
memory shall occur in a single total order, and each such deallocation call
shall synchronise with the next allocation (if any) in this order.</p>

<h2>Issue 0405: mutex specification not aligned with C++11 on total order</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Batty<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The C11 specification of mutexes is missing the total order over all the calls
on a particular mutex. This is present in C++11. The following is from
30.4.1.2p5 in
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/prot/14882fdis/n3291.pdf">N3291</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For purposes of determining the existence of a data race, these behave as atomic
operations (1.10). The lock and unlock operations on a single mutex shall appear
to occur in a single total order. [ Note: this can be viewed as the
modification order (1.10) of the mutex. — end note ]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The synchronisation in 7.26.4 is defined in terms of some order over these
calls, even though none is specified, for instance 7.26.4.4p2 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior calls to mtx_unlock on the same mutex shall synchronize with this
operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like simple omission. We suggest adding a new paragraph to 7.26.4
that matches C++11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For purposes of determining the existence of a data race, mutex calls behave as
atomic operations. The lock and unlock operations on a single mutex shall appear
to occur in a single total order.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> This can be viewed as the modification order of the mutex.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It has been mathematically proved that a simplification can be made to the
memory model as it is specified in the final draft of the C++11 standard.
Essentially, the restriction defining <em>visible sequence of side effects</em> (vsse)
is redundant and can be removed with no ill effects. The main motivation for
doing this is that the current restriction is misleading. 5.1.2.4p22 defines
vsse's:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The visible sequence of side effects on an atomic object <code>M</code>, with respect to a
value computation <code>B</code> of <code>M</code>, is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence of side
effects in the modification order of <code>M</code>, where the first side effect is visible
with respect to <code>B</code>, and for every subsequent side effect, it is not the case
that <code>B</code> happens before it. The value of an atomic object <code>M</code>, as determined by
evaluation B, shall be the value stored by some operation in the visible
sequence of <code>M</code> with respect to <code>B</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wording of this paragraph makes it seem as if the vsse identifies the writes
that an atomic read is allowed to read from, but this is not the case. There can
be writes in the vsse that cannot be read due to the coherence requirements (to
be included in C, 1.10p15 through 1.10p18 in C++
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/prot/14882fdis/n3291.pdf">N3291</a>).
Consequently this is even more confusing than it at first appears.</p>
<p>Also propose changing 5.1.2.4p22 to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of an atomic object <code>M</code>, as determined by evaluation <code>B</code>, shall be the
value stored by some side effect <code>A</code> that modifies <code>M</code>, where <code>B</code> does not
happen before <code>A</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a note to remind the reader of the coherence requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> The set of side effects that a given evaluation might take its value
from is also restricted by the rest of the rules described here, and in
particular, by the coherence requirements below</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the committee is concerned about allowing a differing text from C++11, then
a note could be added to assure the reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Although the rules for multi-threaded executions differ here from those
of C++11, the executions they allow are precisely the same. Visible sequences
of side effects are a redundant restriction.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<p>These changes have been proposed for the C++ working draft:</p>
<ul>
<li>For C 5.1.2.4 paragraph 2, the following C++ discussion is relevant:
<blockquote>
<p>Change 1.10 paragraph 14 as follows:</p>

</li>
<li>For C 5.1.2.4 paragraph 24, the following C++ discussion is relevant:

<p>1.10p20 should be changed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[ <em>Note:</em> The <del>visible sequence of side effects</del> <ins>value observed

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>For C 5.1.2.4 paragraph 27, the following C++ discussion is relevant:

shared memory location that would not be modified by the abstract machine are
generally precluded by this standard, since such an assignment might overwrite
another assignment by a different thread in cases in which an abstract machine

of data member assignment that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory
locations. Reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question
may alias is also generally precluded, since this may violate the <del>"visible
sequence"</del><ins>coherence</ins> rules. —<em>end note</em> ]</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>For C 7.17.3 paragraph 6, the following C++ discussion is relevant:

<h2>Issue 0407: SC fences do not restrict modification order enough</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Batty<br />
Date: 2011-10-14<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1584.pdf">N1584</a><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>C11 seems to omit the restriction imposed in C++11 in 29.3p7 (from
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/prot/14882fdis/n3291.pdf">N3291</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For atomic operations <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> on an atomic object <code>M</code>, if there are
<code>memory_order_seq_cst fences X</code> and <code>Y</code> such that <code>A</code>is sequenced before <code>X</code>,
<code>Y</code> is sequenced before <code>B</code>, and <code>X</code> precedes <code>Y</code> in <code>S</code>, then <code>B</code> occurs later
than <code>A</code> in the modification order of <code>M</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, it seems that both C11 and C++11 are missing the following two
derivatives of this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For atomic modifications <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> of an atomic object <code>M</code>, if there is a
<code>memory_order_seq_cst fence X</code> such that <code>A</code> is sequenced before <code>X</code>, and <code>X</code>
precedes <code>B</code> in <code>S</code>, then <code>B</code> occurs later than <code>A</code> in the modification order of
<code>M</code>.</p>
<p>For atomic modifications <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> of an atomic object <code>M</code>, if there is a
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> fence <code>Y</code> such that <code>Y</code> is sequenced before <code>B</code>, and <code>A</code>
precedes <code>Y</code> in <code>S</code>, then <code>B</code> occurs later than <code>A</code> in the modification order of
<code>M</code>.</p>

<h2>Issue 0408: Should locks provide intra-thread synchronization</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Batty<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Most of the C++ standard, synchronisation is used exclusively inter-thread, so
in particular, synchronisation can't be used to avoid undefined behavior arising
from conflicting un-sequenced memory accesses, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>(x<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">1</span>)<span style="color: #666666">==</span>(x<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">2</span>)
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, C does not define this sort of thing as undefined behavior. Is this
intentional? Secondly in C++ locks can currently be used to fix up such
programs and avoid undefined behavior, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>(lock;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">1</span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>unlock;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x)<span style="color: #666666">==</span>(lock;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">2</span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>unlock;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x)
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>The reason not to allow this sort of synchronisation in general is, because it
disallows some single threaded compiler optimisations. Is intra-thread locking
intended to be defined and usable?</p>

<h2>Issue 0409: <code>f(inf)</code> is <code>inf</code> being a range error</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Fred J. Tydeman (USA)<br />
Date: 2012-01-11<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Several of the functions in <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code> that compute infinity for <code>f(infinity)</code>
have the phrase (or something similar):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A range error occurs if the magnitude of x is too large.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since infinity is 'too large', one might conclude that <code>f(infinity)</code> is a range
error for those functions.</p>
<p>However, 7.12.1#5 has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A floating result overflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is
finite but so large that the mathematical result cannot be represented without
extraordinary roundoff error ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word being 'finite'. So, one could conclude f(infinity) being infinity
is not overflow (and therefore, not a range error).</p>
<p>To me, this appears to be a contradiction. I have encountered both kinds of
implementations; some treat this case as a range error, and others that do not.</p>
<p>For both LIA and IEEE-754, f(infinity) being infinity is not considered an
error.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The committee rejected the Suggested Change in the main body of this defect report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee considered the following, but rejected it (as just being a restatement of 7.12.1 paragraphs 4 and 5).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the result overflows, a range error shall occur.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>A question arose as to why these range error cases are listed in the individual functions (instead of just being covered by the blanket 7.12.1 paragraphs 4, 5, and 6)</p>
<p>7.12.1 paragraph 1 has the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The behavior of each of the functions in &lt;math.h&gt; is specified for all
representable values of its input arguments, except where stated otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several other approaches were discussed, without any consensus reached</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a footnote to 7.12.1 paragraph 5, first sentence:
<blockquote>
<p>In an implementation that supports infinities, a range error may happen for
functions that map an infinity argument into an exact infinity or exact zero
result.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Add to end of 7.12.1 paragraph 4:
<blockquote>
<p>Recommended practice</p>
<p>In an implementation that supports infinities, a range error should not happen
for functions that map an infinity argument into an exact infinity or exact zero
result.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Add to 7.12.1 paragraph 4:
<blockquote>
<p>An implementation may define additional range errors, provided that such errors
are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Fred wrote a paper <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1629.htm">N1629</a> discussing "Fixing a contradiction" and "Taking care of infinity".</li>
<li>The definition of range error, however, in 7.12.1 paragraph 4 indicates infinity is excluded (since it has a representation), and as such no change is required.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred presented another paper
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1979.htm">N1979</a> noting an
error in the October 2012 committee response, and after discussion, the proposed
clarification was adopted, and is as follows</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<p>The definition of range error in 7.12.1 paragraph 4 excludes infinity.</p>
<p>For example, <code>exp(+infinity)</code> is <code>+infinity</code>. Since the input <code>+infinity</code> is
representable, then the output <code>+infinity</code> is representable in an object of the
specified type. By, 7.12.1 paragraph 4, a range error has not happened. Also, by
7.12.1 paragraph 5, since the result is not finite, overflow has not happened.</p>

<p>For the case of converting a large finite value to an integer value, lrint and
lround have one set of requirements, while ilogb has another set. This is
inconsistent.</p>
<p>Both 7.12.9.5 The lrint and llrint functions and 7.12.9.7 The lround and llround
functions have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the rounded value is outside the range of the return type, the numeric result
is unspecified and a domain error or range error may occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While 7.12.6.5 The ilogb functions has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the correct value is outside the range of the return type, the numeric result
is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that the following changes to C11 should be done.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>7.12.6.5 The ilogb functions:</p>
<p>Change to: If the correct value is outside the range of the return type, the
numeric result is unspecified and a domain error or range error may occur.</p>

<h2>Issue 0412: <code>#elif</code></h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It appears that <code>#elif</code> is not entirely equivalent to <code>#else</code>, <code>#if</code>, and
<code>#endif</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the code:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#if 1</span>
...
<span style="color: #9C6500">#else</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">#if this is not a valid expression</span>
...
<span style="color: #9C6500">#endif</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">#endif</span>
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>This is well-defined. Since the controlling expression of the <code>#if</code> evaluates to
true, the <code>#else</code> group is skipped and thus the nested <code>#if</code> is only processed
through the directive name (6.10.1p6).</p>
<p>However, if this is recast using <code>#elif</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#if 1</span>
...
<span style="color: #9C6500">#elif this is not a valid expression</span>
...
<span style="color: #9C6500">#endif</span>
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>the <code>#elif</code> is not part of a group that is skipped and thus must be processed
completely, including evaluating the controlling condition (even though the
resulting value is of no interest).</p>
<p>I do not believe this was the committee's intent.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In 6.10.1p6, change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the first group whose control condition evaluates to true (nonzero) is
processed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the first group whose control condition evaluates to true (nonzero) is
processed; any following groups are skipped and their controlling directives are
processed as if they were in a group that is skipped.</p>

<p>The question is: what is now the value of <code>l.t.k</code>? Is it 42 (due to the
initialization of <code>.t = x</code>) or is it 0 (due to the fact that <code>.t.l</code> starts an
incomplete initialization of <code>.t</code>?</p>
<p>The relevant clause from the standard is 6.7.9 clause 19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>19 The initialization shall occur in initializer list order, each initializer
provided for a particular subobject overriding any previously listed initializer
for the same subobject;<sup>151</sup>) all subobjects that are not initialized
explicitly shall be initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static
storage duration.</p>

<ul>
<li>It was noted that this is basically similar to <a href="log_c99.html#issue0253">dr_253</a>.</li>
<li>The following was proposed, but there was no consensus for adoption.
<blockquote>
<p>The initialization shall occur in initializer list order, each initializer

</blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2012 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The original author intended the result to be 42 by the following reasoning:</li>
<li>6.7.9 paragraphs 17-18 specify that each designator list affects only the smallest subobject to which the designator list refers. As a result, the second clause of paragraph 19 occurs once for the greater object as a whole, filling in only those parts of the whole object that were never initialized explicitly.</li>
<li><strong>gcc</strong> and some IBM compilers give the result as 0, although it is not believed that there is code dependent on this interpretation.</li>
<li>David Keaton proposed <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1659.pdf">N1659</a>.</li>
<li>This, however, does not clarify the interpreted conflict of paragraph 19 "subobjects that are not initialized explicitly [shall be set to zero]" applied "recursively to subaggregates" (paragraph 20).</li>
<li>Adding the example is a desired outcome.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Apr 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no work performed on this DR.</p>
<p>Although both GCC and six compilers from IBM provide the unintended answer, it
is believed to be such a rarely used feature that it is not depended upon to a
great degree, and the compiler venders are willing to change their behavior
appropriately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been considerable discussion and several proposals ( N1659, N1749) to
clarify the standard to no avail. Upon reflection, and consultation with the
author, we believe that the proper course of action is twofold. First, simply
answer the question asked as the committee believes that the standard already
specifies correctly. To add clarification to the standard we will also add the
examples from N1659 that leads to this answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<p>The proper answer to the question raised according to the standard is that the
value of l.t.k is 42, because implicit initialization does not override explicit
initialization. We will also provide a non-normative example to further clarify
the intent.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The standard does not specify if or when destructors for thread specific data
keys (created with the <code>tss_create</code> function) are invoked.</p>
<p>This proposal suggests to align the behavior with that specified by POSIX for
<code>pthread_key_t</code>. This behavior is hoped to both match the intention of the
standard, and be possible to implement on other systems (it is noted that a
pthreads implementation exists for Windows, for example, while the behavior of
POSIX and Windows thread local storage implementations differ greatly)</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>After 7.26.5.1p2, add</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returning from <code>func</code> shall have the same behaviour as invoking <code>thrd_exit</code> with
the returned value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change 7.26.5.5 parts 2 and 3 from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>thrd_exit</code> function terminates execution of the calling thread and sets its
result code to <code>res</code>.</p>
<p>The program shall terminate normally after the last thread has been terminated.
The behavior shall be as if the program called the exit function with the
status EXIT_SUCCESS at thread termination time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every thread specific storage key which was created with a non-NULL
destructor and for which the value is non-NULL, <code>thrd_exit</code> shall set the value
associated with the key to NULL and then invoke the destructor with its previous
value. The order in which destructors are invoked is unspecified.</p>
<p>If after this process there remain keys with both non-NULL destructors and
values, the implementation shall repeat this process up to <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code>
times.</p>
<p>If <code>thrd_exit</code> is not being invoked in the last thread in the process, then the
implementation shall terminate execution of the calling thread and set its
result code to <code>res</code>. Otherwise, the implementation shall behave as
if <code>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)</code> was invoked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This change provides application writers guarantees about the identity of the
thread executing functions registered with <code>atexit</code>)</p>
<p>After 7.26.6.1p2, add</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value NULL shall be associated with the newly created key in all existing
threads. Upon thread creation, the value associated with all keys shall be
initialized to NULL</p>
<p>Note that destructors associated thread specific storage are not invoked at
process exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To 7.26.6.2p2, append</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <code>tss_delete</code> is called while another thread is executing destructors, whether
this will affect the number of invocations of the destructor associated
with <code>key</code> on that thread is unspecified. If the thread from which <code>tss_delete</code>
is invoked is executing destructors, then no further invocations of the
destructor associated with <code>key</code> will occur on said thread.</p>
<p>Calling <code>tss_delete</code> will not result in the invocation of any destructors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After 7.26.6.4p2, add</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This action will not invoke the destructor associated with the key on the value
being replaced.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This paper was discussed in conjunction with <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0424">DR424</a> which covers one additional related issue.</li>
<li>The key observation is that these papers are about the deliberate underspecification of threads, since that allows the greatest opportunity for implementation on a variety of operating systems.</li>
<li>Pete Becker, an implementor of the C11 threads library, was asked about these papers and replied in SC22/WG14 message 12813.</li>
<li>Based on that response the committee is concerned that there could be subtleties in adopting the Proposed Technical Corrigendum and that, as such, these changes are substantial enough to warrant a proposal and to not be considered a defect.</li>

<li>The suggested technical corrigendum would specify new instances of undefined behavior as well as new requirements on implementations.</li>
<li>The committee expressed concern that some of the new requirements may be onerous or impossible to provide above the native platform implementation.</li>

and much discussion, the committee has agreed on the following as the
resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>After 7.26.5.1 paragraph 2, add</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returning from <code>func</code> shall have the same behavior as invoking <code>thrd_exit</code> with

<p>Change 7.26.5.5, replace paragraph 2 with:</p>

<p>If after this process there remain keys with both non-null destructors and
values, the implementation shall repeat this process up to <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code>
times.</p>
<p>Following this, the <code>thrd_exit</code> function terminates execution of the calling
thread and sets its result code to <code>res</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After 7.26.6.1 paragraph 2, add the following new paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value <code>NULL</code> shall be associated with the newly created key in all existing
threads. Upon thread creation, the value associated with all keys shall be
initialized to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p>Destructors associated with thread-specific storage are not invoked at program
termination.</p>
<p>A call to <code>tss_create</code> from within a destructor results in undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 7.26.6.2 paragraph 2, add the following new second sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A call to <code>tss_delete</code> function results in undefined behavior if the call to
<code>tss_create</code> which set <code>key</code> completed after the thread commenced executing
destructors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After 7.26.6.2 paragraph 2, add the following new paragraphs:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In 7.26.6.3 paragraph 2, add the following new second sentence:</p>

<h2>Issue 0418: <code>fmod(0.,Nan)</code> and <code>fmod(Nan, infinity)</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Fred J. Tydeman (USA)<br />
Date: 2012-09-13<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1633.htm">N1633</a><br />
<strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1497.htm">N1497</a><br />
Status: Closed<br />
Converted from: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2396.htm">n2396.htm</a></p>
<p>First question. When Annex F is in effect, what should the value of fmod(0.,NaN)
be? The two choices are 0. or NaN.</p>
<p>Annex F.10.7.1 The fmod functions has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fmod(+/-0, y) returns +/-0 for y not zero.</li>
<li>fmod(x, y) returns a NaN and raises the “invalid” floating-point exception for x infinite or y zero (and neither is a NaN).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, that first bullet item says fmod(0.,NaN) is 0.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in that annex (F.10 Mathematics, paragraph 11), we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functions with a NaN argument return a NaN result and raise no floating-point
exception, except where stated otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That says that fmod(0.,NaN) is NaN.</p>
<p>One idea is to explicitly add words about a NaN to the first bullet item in
F.10.7.1, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fmod(+/-0, y) returns +/-0 for y not zero nor NaN.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if F.10#11 covers NaN arguments before any other arguments are
considered, then words about NaN could be removed from the second case in
F.10.7.1, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fmod(x, y) returns a NaN and raises the “invalid” floating-point exception for x infinite or y zero.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that takes us back to before N1497 was done.</p>
<p>Second question: what should fmod(NaN,infinity) be? Must it be the same NaN
argument, or may it be any NaN?</p>
<p>Annex F.10.7.1 The fmod functions has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fmod(x, +/-infinity) returns x for x not infinite.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Which says fmod(NaN,infinity) must be the same NaN argument.</p>
<p>But, if F.10#11 covers this NaN argument, then this case is just some NaN.</p>
<p>It appears that the third bullet should either be left alone or changed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fmod(x, +/-infinity) returns x for finite x.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some other functions that discuss NaN arguments in Annex F are: frexp, ilogb,
modf, hypot, pow, fmax, fmin, and fma. Of those, only hypot, pow, fmax, and fmin
have exceptions on NaN in implies NaN out.</p>

<p>Comment from WG14 on 2013-04-26:</p>
<p>Oct 2012 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given that, unless stated otherwise, if the argument is a NaN, the result is a NaN, and there is no floating point exception.</li>
<li>The parenthetical comment <strong>might</strong> be causing confusion, and removing it seems to make it more confusing.</li>
<li>Adding more explicit wording is possible but seems unnecessary.</li>

<h2>Issue 0419: What the heck is a "generic function"?</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>What the heck is a "generic function", and what are the sections of the standard
covering how a user (or implementor) can write a stardard conforming program
defining a "type generic function"?</p>
<p>I was trying to reconcile the rules in 7.1.4 Use of library functions allowing
an implementation to define a function as a macro, and the user suppressing the
macro by enclosing the name of the function in parentheses. But, I don't see how
to make a function declaration, where a parameter can be any atomic type.</p>
<p>I've convinced myself, generic functions will take compiler magic. There is no
way to declare them using C standard conforming code. Just like the type generic
macros of &lt;tgmath.h&gt; in C99.</p>
<p>Somehow I missed this. I remember all the discussion of adding atomic operation
to operators like += but somehow I missed the fact we were again adding in
function specifications that cannot be implemented using standard C. I thought
we were adding type generic macros. Sigh ...</p>
<p>I've been told that the discussion included talk about a proposal to recast them
as generic macros, but that never happened so we ended up with generic functions
through the back door without much explication.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Redefine the atomic type generic functions as type generic macros. Define the
underlying functions to which the type generic macros expand.</p>

<p>Oct 2012 meeting</p>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>7.17.1 add a new paragraph after paragraph 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is unspecified whether any generic function declared in <code>stdatomic.h</code> is a
macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is
suppressed in order to access an actual function, or a program defines an
external identifier with the name of a generic function, the behavior is
undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>J.2 add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The macro definition of a generic function is suppressed in order to access an
actual function (7.17.1)</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The standard lists two different forms for the <code>for</code>-statement in 6.8.5p1:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">for</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression[opt]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression[opt]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression[opt]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>)<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>statement

</pre></div>

<p>whereas later in 6.8.5.3 these two forms are subsumed in a third form by:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">for</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>clause<span style="color: #666666">-1</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression<span style="color: #666666">-2</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression<span style="color: #666666">-3</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>)<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>statement
</pre></div>

<p>Obviously the second form above is a typo and doesn't fit within this third
form, the semantic that is given in 6.8.5.3 and to common practice in existing
compilers.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Replace the second form in 6.8.5p1 and A.2.3 by the intended one:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">for</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>declaration<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression[opt]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression[opt]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>expression[opt]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>)<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>statement

<h2>Issue 0421: initialization of <code>atomic_flag</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Jens Gustedt<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>C11 expresses the intention to have <code>atomic_flag</code> as a primitive that should
allow to emulate all other atomic types and operations, <em>7.17.8 p3</em> in a note
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remaining types can be emulated with <code>atomic_flag</code>, though with less than
ideal properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the current semantic for the initialization of <code>atomic_flag</code> this goal
cannot be achieved.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>This is a very good concept as far as I can see, but I have one problem to
achieve this, initialization. The phrasing for atomic types in general and for
<code>atomic_flag</code> are different. For <code>atomic_flag</code> we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An atomic_flag that is not explicitly initialized with <code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code> is
initially in an indeterminate state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is how to emulate an atomic type with <code>atomic_flag</code> during
initialization. Say we emulate with something like</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">atomic_int_struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span>atomic_flag<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>cat;
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>val;
};
</pre></div>

<p>Then the <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro could simply look like:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(V) { .cat = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT, .val = (V), }</span>
</pre></div>

<p>But if I’d have a variable of <code>atomic_int_struct</code> with static storage duration</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">atomic_int_struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>v;
</pre></div>

<p>is supposed to do the right thing, namely to guarantee that <code>v</code> has a valid
state at startup, so it should contain a <code>0</code> for <code>.val</code>, and <code>.cat</code> must be in a
determinate state. Since all atomic operations should work without problems on
<code>v</code>, the state of <code>.cat</code> can’t be anything else than “clear”.</p>
<p>Now looking into the possible implementations of <code>atomic_flag</code> in assembler I
didn’t yet meet a processor where the “clear” state would not be naturally
represented by an all <code>0</code> value. So I guess in any reasonable implementation we
would just have</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT { 0 }</span>
</pre></div>

<p>(or some equivalent formulation.)</p>
<p>If this is so, why <code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code> at all? Why not phrasing the same as for
the other atomic types</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Eliminate the mention of <code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code> in 7.17.1p3, B.16 and the index.</p>
<p>Proposed change for the initialization of <code>atomic_flag</code>, 7.17.8p4:</p>
<p><ins>The default initializer <code>{ 0 }</code> may be used to initialize an <code>atomic_flag</code>
to the clear state. An <code>atomic_flag</code> object with automatic storage duration that
is not explicitly initialized using <code>{ 0 }</code> is initially in an indeterminate
state; <em>however, the default (zero) initialization for objects with static or
thread-local storage duration initializes an <code>atomic_flag</code> to the clear state.</em><br />
EXAMPLE</ins></p>
<p><ins><code>atomic_flag guard = { 0 };</code></ins></p>
<p>If the committee would want to keep the macro <code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code> arround, a
partial alternative to the above text would be to modify the text in 7.17.1</p>
<p><ins><code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code></ins></p>
<p><ins>which expands to a default initializer (<code>{ 0 }</code> or equivalent) for an
object of type <code>atomic_flag</code>.</ins></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The mentioned valid state (in contrast to the indeterminate state mentioned
before) is thus a determinate state, but the value that is stored is not
mentioned explicitly. In the introduced language of the standard it is no
definition of a "determinate state". It could be an "implementation-defined
value", just an "unspecified value" or a default (zero) initialization.
Everything suggests the later, that this would be the same value as for
initializing a variable of the underlying base type by <code>{ 0 }</code>. But I think it
would have helped to make that explicit.</p>

<h2>Issue 0423: Defect Report relative to n1570: underspecification for qualified rvalues</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Jens Gustedt<br />
Date: 2012-10-08<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The dealing of rvalues with qualified types is largely underspecified in all
versions of the C standard. This didn't surface as a problem until C11, since
until then the type of an expression was not observable but only its value.</p>
<p>With C11 now a problem arises for type generic primary expressions; with
<code>_Generic</code> type qualifications of values have become observable.</p>
<p>The standard in any of its versions has not much to say when it comes to
qualified types for rvalues. They definitively do exist, since the cast operator
(6.5.4p2) explicitly specifies that the type could be qualified. That section on
casts also has the only indication that relates to rvalues. There is a footnote
(thus not normative) that says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>89) A cast does not yield an lvalue. Thus, a cast to a qualified type has the
same effect as a cast to the unqualified version of the type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That could mean two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>the effective type of the resulting rvalue is unqualified</li>
<li>all operators that will accept the rvalue as an operand will act all the same whether the type is qualified or not</li>
</ol>
<p>doing some tests I have found that clang and gcc disagree on this point. (gcc
doesn't have <code>_Generic</code>, yet, but other builtins to observe types)</p>
<p>clang seems to implement 1., gcc 2. They agree for lvalues like this</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">_Generic</span>((<span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">const</span>){<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>},

</pre></div>

<p>both evaluate it to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>They disagree on the outcome for rvalues</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">_Generic</span>((<span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">const</span>)<span style="color: #666666">0</span>,

</pre></div>

<p>clang gives <code>0</code>, gcc gives <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>(for gcc all with caution that it doesn't have <code>_Generic</code> yet, but that this was
obtained using an emulation of it by means of other gcc builtins)</p>
<p>So that situation can easily lead to simple programs that have a behavior that
depends on an undocumented choice and thus observe <em>unspecified behavior</em>.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>Importance of observability of qualifiers</h4>
<p>This is not a defect of the <code>_Generic</code> construct itself. The intention is
clearly to distinguish all types (with the exception of VM types) that are not
compatible, thus to allow to distinguish all 8 different forms of qualifications
of a type (resp. 16 for pointer types) that can be obtained from the qualifiers
<code>_Atomic</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>volatile</code> (and <code>restrict</code>).</p>
<p>For type generic expressions that are intended to operate on lvalues, such
distinction can be crucial for any of the four qualifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>const</code> or <code>volatile</code> qualified lvalues there might be situations where application code might want to use an unqualified compound literal in place of the controlling expression.</li>
<li>For <code>_Atomic</code> qualified lvalues there might be situations where application code might want to select a different function than for expressions with same base type but without such a qualifier.</li>
<li><code>restrict</code> (or not) qualified pointers may enable an application to select different algorithms or functions (e.g <code>memcopy</code> versus <code>memmove</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lvalue conversion of the controlling expression of the generic selection is not a solution</h4>
<p>Up to now, the conversions of 6.3.2.1 do not apply to primary expressions but
only to operators. E.g in the following</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>A[<span style="color: #666666">5</span>];
<span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #666666">*</span>B)[<span style="color: #666666">5</span>]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&amp;</span>A;
<span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #666666">*</span>C)[<span style="color: #666666">5</span>]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&amp;</span>(A);
</pre></div>

<p><code>B</code> and <code>C</code> should be initialized to the same value, the address of <code>A</code>. If in
<code>(A)</code> the primary expression <code>()</code> would enforce a decay of the array to a
pointer (and thus to an rvalue) the initialization expression for <code>C</code> would be a
constraint violation.</p>
<p>So it seems obvious that the conversions in 6.3.2 ("Other Operands") are not
intended to be applied to primary expressions.</p>
<p>Also the conversions in 6.3.2 are not consistent with respect to qualifiers. The
only conversion that explicitly drops qualifiers is lvalue conversion
(6.3.2.1p2). Array to pointer conversion (6.3.2.1p3) doesn't change qualifiers
on the base type. Pointer conversion then, in 6.3.2.3, may add qualifiers to the
base type when converting.</p>
<h4>Origin</h4>
<p>Two different constructs can be at the origin of a qualification of an rvalue:</p>
<ul>
<li>casts, but only for scalar types</li>
<li>function evaluation, resulting in any type but an array or function type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both constructs explicitly allow for qualifiers to be applied to the type. In
particular 6.7.6.3p15 emphasizes (and constrains) the return type of function
specifications to have compatible types, thus indicating that the qualification
of the return type bares a semantic meaning.</p>
<h4>Operations</h4>
<p>If we suppose that any rvalue expression carries its qualification further,
other operations (e.g unary or binary <code>+</code>) could or could not result in
qualified rvalues. The conversion rules in 6.3 and in particular the usual
arithmetic conversions in 6.3.1.8 that allow to determine a common real type
don't specify rules to deal with qualifiers.</p>
<p>It seems that a lot of compilers already warn on such "superfluous"
qualifications, but in view of type generic primary expression it is not clear
that such warnings are still adequate.</p>
<h4>Comparison to C++</h4>
<p>C++ had to resolve this problem since its beginnings, because the feature of
function overloading together with references of rvalues had made rvalue types
and their qualifications observable.</p>
<p>Interestingly, to solve the problem the C++ refers to the C standard, claiming
that C would drop all qualifiers for rvalue expressions that have scalar base
type. It does this without refering to a particular text in the C standard, and
in fact it can't since there doesn't seem to be such text.</p>
<p>The actual solution in C++ is thus that all rvalue expressions of non-scalar
types are <code>const</code>-qualified and that those of scalar types are unqualified. In
view that scalar types are exactly those types that are allowed to have cast
operators that qualify the type, all of this looks like a useless additional
complication of the issue.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>There doesn't seem to be an easy solution to this defect, and the proposed
solutions (as below or even differently) probably will need some discussion and
investigations about their implications on existing code before a consensus
could be reached.</p>
<h4>Proposal 1: Require the implementation to specify its choice</h4>
<p>This is (to my opinion) the worst solution, because the potential different code
paths that an application code could take are numerous. There are 4 different
qualifiers to handle and code that would have to rely on enumerating all
combinations of different generic choices can quickly become a maintenance
nightmare.</p>
<p>Also, implementations that chose to keep qualifiers on rvalues would have to
decide (and document) by their own what the rules would be when operators are
applied to such qualified rvalues.</p>
<h4>Proposal 2: Keep all qualifiers on types of rvalue expressions</h4>
<p>For this solution in should be then elaborated how operators handle qualifiers.
A natural way would be to accumulate qualifiers from operands with different
qualifiers.</p>
<p>An important issue with this approach is the rapidly increasing number of cases,
in particular 16 for pointer types. To keep the number of cases low when
programming with type generic expressions we would need a <em>generic</em> tool for the
following:</p>
<p>How to drop qualifiers for type generic expressions? Or alternatively add all
qualifiers?</p>
<p>For arithmetic types with base type other than <code>_Bool</code>, <code>char</code>, or <code>short</code>
something like the following would be useful:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #666666">+</span>(X)<span style="color: #bbbbbb">                                 </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">// if unary plus drops all qualifiers</span>
(X)<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">+</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">const</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">volatile</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">_Atomic</span>)<span style="color: #666666">0</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">// if qualifiers accumulate</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This strategy wouldn't work for the narrow types, because the are promoted to
<code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>.</p>
<h4>Proposal 3: Require the implementation to provide a feature test macro</h4>
<p>This solution would already be a bit better than the previous one, since
applications that compose type generic macros could select between two (or
several) implementations. But the main problems (complexity and
underspecification of operations) would remain.</p>
<h4>Proposal 4: Drop all qualifiers from the controlling expression of the generic selection</h4>
<p>This is not an ideal solution, since it would remove a lot of expressiveness
from the generic selection construct. Lvalues could no be distinguished for
their qualifiers:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">void</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #666666">*</span>);
<span style="color: #9C6500">#define F(X) _Generic((X), double: f)(&amp;(X))</span>

<span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">const</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>A<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">42</span>;
F(A);
</pre></div>

<p>Here dropping the qualifiers of <code>A</code> would result in a choice of <code>f</code> and in the
evaluation of <code>f(&amp;A)</code>. In case that <code>f</code> modifies its argument object (which we
can't know) this would lead to undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Not dropping the qualifiers would lead to a compile time constraint violation,
because none of the types in the type generic expression matches. So here an
implementation would be forced to issue a diagnostic, whereas if qualifiers are
dropped the diagnostic is not mandatory.</p>
<h4>Proposal 5: Drop all qualifiers of rvalues</h4>
<p>This solution seems the one that is chosen by clang. It is probably the easiest
to specify. As mentioned above it has the disadvantage that the two very similar
expressions <code>(int const){0}</code> and <code>(int const)0</code> have different types.</p>
<p>Some clarification should be added to the standard, though.</p>
<p><ins>6.5.1.1, modify as follows:<br />
EXAMPLE The <code>cbrt</code> type-generic macro could be implemented as follows. Here the
prefix operator <code>+</code> in the selection expression ensures that lvalue conversion
on arithmetic types is performed such that e.g lvalues of type <code>float const</code>
select <code>cbrtf</code> and not the default <code>cbrt</code>.</ins></p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define cbrt(X) _Generic(+(X), \</span>

<span style="color: #9C6500">default: cbrt,                 \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">float: cbrtf                   \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">)(X)</span>
</pre></div>

<p><ins>6.5.2.2, add after p1: The type of a function call is the return type of
the function without any qualifiers.</ins></p>
<p><ins>6.5.4, add after p2: The type of a cast expression of a qualified scalar
type is the scalar type without any qualifiers.</ins></p>
<p><ins>6.7.63, change p15, first sentence: For two function types to be
compatible, the unqualified versions of both return types shall be
compatible.</ins></p>
<p><strong>C11:</strong> When introduced like this, this will invalidate some valid C11
programs, since some type generic expression might behave differently. The
faster such corrigendum is adopted the less likely it is that such programs
exist.</p>
<h4>Proposal 6: Add a <code>const</code> qualifier to all types for rvalues</h4>
<p>Analogous as in the case above it has the disadvantage that the two very similar
expressions <code>(int){0}</code> and <code>(int)0</code> have different types.</p>
<p>This is my favorite solution, since it also "repairs" another issue that I am
unconfortable with: the problem of array decay in objects with temporary
lifetime:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">T</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>a[<span style="color: #666666">4</span>];<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>}<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>A;

<p>Here <code>f()</code> is an rvalue that results in an object of temporary lifetime <code>struct T</code> and then <code>f().a</code> decays to a <code>double*</code>. Semantically a better solution would
be that it decays to a <code>double const*</code> since a modification of the value is not
allowed (undefined behavior). Already with C99 it would be clearer to declare
<code>g1</code> as:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF">g1</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">const</span><span style="color: #666666">*</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x)<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">*</span>x;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>}
</pre></div>

<p>If <code>f()</code> would be of type <code>struct T const</code>, <code>f().a</code> would decay to a <code>double const*</code>. Then a call of <code>g0</code> would be a constraint violation and <code>g1</code> would have
to be used.</p>
<p>The necessary changes to the standard would be something like:</p>
<p><ins>6.5.1.1, modify as follows:<br />

of temporary lifetime behind the pointer. Unless for very old legacy functions
(from before the introduction of <code>const</code> to the language) such interfaces should
be able to use the "correct" <code>const</code>-qualification, or they could be overloaded
with a type generic interface that takes care of that issue.</p>

<li>Handling of the atomic type qualifier may be the most likely defect, if there is one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apr 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The intent of the Standard is most clearly reflected in the author's Proposal 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clark Nelson provided an in-depth analysis of Proposal 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suggested changes to 6.5.1.1 are unnecessary. The controlling expression of a generic selection was very carefully <em>not</em> added to the list of contexts in which lvalue conversion is not done and type qualification is discarded; see 6.3.2.1p2. As such, the controlling expression of a generic selection can not have qualified type. It was thought that a note to that effect might be useful in 6.5.1.1p3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suggested addition to 6.5.4 is useful, but a better change would be to change 6.5.4p5 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preceding an expression by a parenthesized type name converts the value of the
expression to <ins>the unqualified version</ins> of the named type. This
construction is called a cast. A cast that specifies no conversion has no effect
on the type or value of an expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, footnote 104 should be reduced to just its first sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suggested changes to 6.5.2.2 and 6.7.63p15 are desirable, but a simpler change would be to remove any qualifier from the declared return type of a function. So, in 6.7.6.3p5, change to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and the type specified for <em>ident</em> in the declaration "<code>T D</code>" is
"<em>derived-declarator-type-list T</em>", then the type specified for <em>ident</em> is
"<em>derived-declarator-type-list</em> function returning <ins>the unqualified version
of</ins> <em>T</em>".</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atomic types may or may not be subject to distinct generic selection and this needs to be resolved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The committee notes that in reflector email 13037 (2013-08-13) that the issue w.r.t. atomics applies to casts, and also needs addressing. The standard was thought to be clear that during conversion to non-atomic type that any implementation size differences are resolved to the non-atomic value, and such conversions would be expected for casts. Such does not seem to be the case, however.</li>
<li>Further refinement of when and where and how to express the treatment of lvalues and non-lvalues has been made. Specifically, the controlling expression of a generic selection "was very carefully not added" to the list of cases where lvalue conversion is not done.</li>
<li>Specifically, change 6.5.4.p5 to:
<blockquote>
<p>Preceding an expression by a parenthesized type name converts the value of the
expression to the unqualified version of the named type. This construction is
called a cast. A cast that specifies no conversion has no effect on the type or
value of an expression. (and delete footnote 104)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Also, change 6.7.63 paragraph 5:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>then the type specified for ident is "derived-declaration-type-list
function returning the unqualified version of T".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>A paper has been solicited to resolve the atomic issues that would argue that type generic selection should apply distinctly to atomic types, as seems to be the direction sought by the submitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apr 2014 meeting</p>

<ul>
<li>The proposed resolution found in <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1803.htm">N1803</a> was withdrawn.</li>
<li>A paper has been solicited to provide a technical corrigendum. It should reflect that the first sentence of footnote 104, "A cast does not yield an lvalue" should be kept.</li>

<h2>Issue 0424: underspecification of <code>tss_t</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Jens Gustedt<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Section 7.26.6 “Thread-specific storage functions” of C11 is severely
underspecified since it uses terms that are not introduced (so far) in the
context of C. This is really a pity, since POSIX also has <code>pthread_key_t</code> that
is completely feature equivalent and for which the specification is much more
complete.</p>
<p>Jacob Navia had observed that at several occasions in <code>comp.std.c</code> but it seems
that he had not got enough attention such that this had made it in a defect
report.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>tss_create</code> function creates a thread-specific storage pointer with
destructor <code>dtor</code>, which may be null.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main problem is that it is nowhere explained/defined</p>
<ul>
<li>what a destructor should be,</li>
<li>when such a destructor should be called,</li>
<li>in which thread context this constructor is executed</li>
<li>what happens when new destructors are added while others are executed</li>
<li>what the meaning of the value of <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code> would be.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>I think several paragraphs should be added after the one above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effect is that for each thread that has the thread specific storage
corresponding to <code>key</code> set to a value <code>x</code> that is not null, the destructor
function <code>*dtor</code> is called with <code>dtor(x)</code> before the thread exits.</p>
<p>This call to <code>dtor</code> is executed in the context of the same thread; it is
sequenced after the <code>return</code> statement or the call to <code>thrd_exit</code> that
terminates the thread and before any return from <code>thrd_join</code> of a waiter for
this same thread. If there are several thread specific storages for the same
thread their destructor functions are called in an unspecific order but with a
sequence point between each of these function calls.</p>
<p>If a destructor function for <code>key</code> issues calls to <code>tss_set</code>, <code>tss_get</code> or
<code>tss_delete</code> with the same <code>key</code> the behavior is undefined.<br />
<code>tss_set</code> can be used to set the value of a thread specific storage for a
different key <code>key2</code> that had not been set before or that has been processed
with a call to the corresponding destructor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that the set of thread specific storages for a given thread may change during
the execution of the corresponding destructors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If after processing all tss that are active at the <code>return</code> of the thread
function or at the end of <code>thrd_exit</code> there are still tss that are active the
procedure of calling destructors is iterated. An implementation may bind the
maximum number such of supplementary iterations by <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second problem is that there are two functionalities that are easily mixed up
and which interrelationship should be clarified: the destructor that is called
(let us suppose this) at exit of a thread, and <code>tss_delete</code> that deletes a
thread specific storage for all running threads. I think something like the
following should be added in 7.26.6.2 after para 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The deletion of <code>key</code> will not change the observable behavior of any of the
active threads. If <code>tss_delete</code> is called for <code>key</code> and there is a thread that
has a non-null value for <code>key</code> that has passed a terminating <code>return</code> statement
or call to <code>thrd_exit</code> but not yet finished the processing of all its tss
destructors, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<h2>Issue 0425: no specification for the access to variables with temporary lifetime</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Section 6.2.4 in p4 and p5 requires implementation defined behavior for
accessing objects with thread local or automatic storage from different threads
than where they are defined. No such mention is done for objects with <em>temporary
lifetime</em> in p8. Can they be accessed by other threads? Is this property handled
similar to the property for automatic storage duration? Or should this simply be
forbidden?</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add to the end of 6.2.4 p8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of attempting to indirectly access an object with temporary lifetime
from a thread other than the one with which the object is associated is
implementation-defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add to 7.26.1p3:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>__STDC_THREAD_TEMPORARY_VISIBLE__

and to 0 otherwise.</p>

defined. No change needed.</p>

<h2>Issue 0426: G.5.1: <code>-yv</code> and <code>-x/v</code> are ambiguous</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The tables in G.5.1 have the mathematical formulas -yv and -x/v. I believe that
they are ambiguous as they could have two meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>(-y)/v and (-x)/v</li>
<li>-(y/v) and -(x/v)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it matters for at least these cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>The two operands are different NaNs, negate flips the sign of a NaN, and the result of * and / depends upon the sign and value of the NaN.</li>
<li>The result is a NaN from non-NaN operands, negate does not flip the sign of a NaN, while both * and / set the sign of the result as the XOR of the signs of the operands.</li>
<li>All operands are non-NaN, the result is inexact and non-NaN, and a rounding that is not symmetric about zero is in effect.</li>

<li>A very long discussion ensued, starting with the fact that C11 notation was used in the clarifying example rather than mathematical notation.</li>
<li>The concerns raised about <code>NaNs</code> were deemed moot by the fact that multiply and divide are not required by either C11 or IEEE-754 to honor the sign of <code>NaNs</code>.</li>
<li>The intended mathematical result seems obvious to most on the committee, and the arguments about mathematical notations were not persuasive.</li>
<li>The third case, however, has modest merit if one considers an implementation that transcribes the provided notation into C11 directly, in which case when asymmetric rounding mode is selected an incorrect result will be formed if negation is applied after the division (or multiplication). More exactly, in the third case, all operands are non-Nan, the result is inexact and non-NaN, and a rounding that is not symmetric about zero is in effect.</li>
<li>As such, the committee, with great reluctance, narrowly formed a consensus for change, and is concerned that this issue is almost certainly not significant enough to warrant the effort already expended, let alone further discussion, lest the entire matter be returned with no changes proposed as a Record of Response.</li>

<h2>Issue 0427: Function Parameter and Return Value Assignments</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The wording for the the assignments of function arguments to function parameters
and for the assignment of a <code>return</code> statement's expression to the value of the
function call can potentially be confused.</p>
<p>6.5.2.2p2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that includes a
prototype, the number of arguments shall agree with the number of parameters.
Each argument shall have a type such that its value may be assigned to an object
with the unqualified version of the type of its corresponding parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appearance of "may be assigned" can lead to the question (#1) of whether or
not the constraints and semantics under both 6.5.16 and 6.5.16.1 might apply.
The <strong>Forward references</strong> indicate 6.5.16.1, so this question might be
unwarranted.</p>
<p>The appearance of "unqualified version of the type of its corresponding
parameter" does not match 6.9.1p10, which doesn't use "unqualified" (see below).</p>
<p>6.5.16p2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An assignment operator shall have a modifiable lvalue as its left operand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If 6.5.2.2p2's mention of "assigned" implies this constraint as a secondary
constraint, it is not clear which "modifiable lvalue" or even "lvalue" would
ever satisfy the constraint. The "modifiable lvalue" does not appear to be the
parameter, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the mention of "unqualified version" suggests a theoretical object, while the parameter might be <code>const</code>-qualified, or</li>
<li>the parameter might have an unqualified structure or union type having at least one <code>const</code>-qualified member (possibly via recursion)</li>
</ul>
<p>6.7.3p4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The properties associated with qualified types are meaningful only for
expressions that are lvalues.132)</p>
<p>132) The implementation may place a const object that is not volatile in a
read-only region of storage. Moreover, the implementation need not allocate
storage for such an object if its address is never used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can suggest that 6.5.2.2p2's "an object with the unqualified version of the
type" implies an lvalue, but (question #2) is it a modifiable lvalue? Question
#3: If the type is a structure or union type with a <code>const</code>-qualified member
(possibly via recursion), are the members considered to be unqualified, too? If
so, this is an important difference from pointer types where the referenced type
(or its referenced type, recursively) would not be considered unqualified. Also
worth consideration would be an array object (which is not qualified) having
elements matching such a structure or union type (possibly via recursion).</p>
<p>The return type of a function might be <code>const</code>-qualified, or might be a
structure or union type having such a member (possibly via recursion). Question
#4: Should the return type of a function be adjusted to be an unqualified
version of the type? Such an adjustment might have implications for type
compatibility and composite type and might be better off left alone. (<code>const</code> is
being used for illustrative purposes, but all type qualifiers can equally be
considerations.)</p>
<p>6.8.6.4p3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a return statement with an expression is executed, the value of the
expression is returned to the caller as the value of the function call
expression. If the expression has a type different from the return type of the
function in which it appears, the value is converted as if by assignment to an
object having the return type of the function.160)</p>
<p>160) The return statement is not an assignment. The overlap restriction of
subclause 6.5.16.1 does not apply to the case of function return. The
representation of floating-point values may have wider range or precision than
implied by the type; a cast may be used to remove this extra range and
precision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the return type of a function is <code>const</code>-qualified, or is a structure or
union type having such a member (possibly via recursion), then "as if by
assignment" works for 6.5.16.1, but the constraint of 6.5.16p2 requires a
"modifiable lvalue".</p>
<p>The footnote reminds us that a <code>return</code> statement with an expression is not an
assignment, but it is not clear that only 6.5.16.1 applies for the "as if by
assignment" case.</p>
<p>6.9.1p10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On entry to the function, the size expressions of each variably modified
parameter are evaluated and the value of each argument expression is converted
to the type of the corresponding parameter as if by assignment. (Array
expressions and function designators as arguments were converted to pointers
before the call.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.9.1p11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all parameters have been assigned, the compound statement that constitutes
the body of the function definition is executed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <code>const</code>-qualified lvalue cannot normally be assigned-to. An lvalue for an
object having a structure or union type containing a <code>const</code>-qualified member
(possible via recursion) cannot normally be assigned-to.</p>
<p>6.9.1p10 doesn't match the use of "unqualified" in 6.5.2.2p2 (see above).</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p><strong>Sun c99</strong> and <strong>GCC</strong> disagree on the <code>return</code> statement's semantics.</p>
<p>Change 6.5.2.2p2 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that includes a
prototype, the number of arguments shall agree with the number of parameters.
Each argument shall be such that it satifies the constraints of simple
assignment when considering the argument to be the right operand and considering
the left operand to have the unqualified version of the type of the
corresponding parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Loosely establishes an example for "as if by simple assignment".)</p>
<p>Change 6.8.6.4p3 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a return statement with an expression is executed, the value of the
expression is returned to the caller as the value of the function call
expression. If the expression has a type different from the return type of the
function in which it appears, the value is converted as if by simple assignment
to an object having the unqualified version of the return type of the
function.160)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change 6.9.1p10 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On entry to the function, the size expressions of each variably modified
parameter are evaluated in an unspecified order, the value of each argument
expression is converted to the unqualified version of the type of the
corresponding parameter as if by simple assignment, then each converted value
becomes the initial value for the corresponding parameter. (Array expressions
and function designators as arguments were converted to pointers before the
call.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change 6.9.1p11 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all parameters have initial values, the compound statement that
constitutes the body of the function definition is executed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add bullet to J.1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- The order in which the size expressions of variably modified parameters are
evaluated upon function entry (6.9.1).</p>

<p>As a result of further correspondence with the author, a proposed resolution was made on the WG14 reflector in message 13024 and refined in 13035.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It is not clear yet whether there are issues around conversions with respect to this change since this is actual practice that we are intending to simply reflect and to not introduce new constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This change might be augmented by a new example along the lines of, say, 6.5.16.1 example 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apr 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue of conversion has to do with whether there are differing promotions
and type conversions that would apply when constructing an argument list that
would not occur if these expressions were used as initializers in a declaration.</p>

<p>Oct 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee concluded after a discussion that there were no promotion or type
conversion issues raised by the proposed wording above, and that the following
should be adopted as a Proposed Technical Corrigendum.</p>

<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum (superceded)</h3>

<p>Apr 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of preserving conversions as if by assignment is fulfilled by the
definition of initialization found in <strong>6.7.9 Initialization</strong> paragraph 11.
Another instance of assignment that should be changed was found in <strong>6.9.1
Function Definitions</strong> paragraph 11.</p>
<p>It was noted that implicit conversion is described only in terms of assignment
(6.5.16.1). There was broad agreement that committee members and implementors
are unconfused by the intent of the standard here despite the inconsistencies.
It was also noted that initialization is distinct from assignment and, in the
case of non-lock free atomic implications, this requires operational differences
and as such that it is worth further consideration. As such, the following
should be regarded as a possible direction.</p>
<p>In 6.5.2.2p2 change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that includes a
prototype, the number of arguments shall agree with the number of parameters.
Each argument shall have a type such that its value may be assigned to an object

</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The committee no longer believes that any of the issues raised in this report warrant changes to the standard.</li>
<li>The difference in behavior on return value semantics cited in gcc has been resolved by a bug fix to gcc</li>
<li>Qualifiers on the return type of a function are superfluous since by resolution to <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0423">DR 423</a> the committee affirms that qualifiers are dropped as part of the evaluation of expressions including function calls.</li>
<li>The committee does agree that the use of “assignment” to describe the initialization of function parameters can be misleading, but that in fact there is not an implementation that has ever been misled. Careful reading of the Standard notes that initialization is described fundamentally “as if by assignment”, and that it would take a comprehensive review and edit of the Standard to possibly achieve a more consistent treatment of the topics. There is a danger of circularity that must be avoided as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee believes that the primary issue of return value semantics was a
consequence of a mistake in the implementation of <code>gcc</code> which has been
rectified, and that further the treatment of qualifiers has been clarified in
the Proposed Technical Corrigendum of <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0423">DR 423</a>. The treatment of
initialization in the Standard is clear enough that no errors have been observed
in implementations, and as such further clarification is unwarranted at this
time.</p>

<h2>Issue 0428: runtime-constraint issue with sprintf family of routines in Annex K</h2>

Date: 2013-02-11<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>snprintf_s  (Annex K.3.5.3.5)</p>
<p>In the "Runtime-constraints" section, K.3.5.3.5p2 first sentence it says:</p>
<p>"Neither s nor format shall be a null pointer. n shall neither equal<br />
zero nor be greater than RSIZE_MAX."</p>
<p>So,</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">if</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(n<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">==</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">||</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>n<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&gt;</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>RSIZE_MAX)
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">        </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">/* runtime constraints violation */</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is clear. However the next paragraph K.3.5.3.5p3, says this about "s":</p>
<p>"If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if s is not a null<br />
pointer and n is greater than zero and less than RSIZE_MAX, then the<br />
snprintf_s function sets s[0] to the null character."</p>
<p>So, it takes action when (n &lt; RSIZE_MAX)</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">        </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">if</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(s<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">!=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000">NULL</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&amp;&amp;</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>n<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&gt;</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&amp;&amp;</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>n<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&lt;</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>RSIZE_MAX)
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">            </span>s[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;\0&#39;</span>;
</pre></div>

<p>Question here is, what if n equals RSIZE_MAX? Should we still reset<br />
s[0]?</p>
<p>If I were to say this looks like a typo, would WG14 agree with me?</p>
<p>That is the text of K.3.5.3.5p3 should be:</p>
<p>If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if s is not a null<br />
pointer and n is greater than zero and not greater than RSIZE_MAX, then the<br />
snprintf_s function sets s[0] to the null character.</p>
<p>This issue applies to all the sprintf family of routines in Annex K</p>

<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Further investigation confirmed that there were several other functions that also need similar corrections to their runtime constraints. All of these additional functions also need additional corrections as specified in <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0433">DR433,</a> and the full resolution of both this defect and the additional issue will be found in the Proposed Technical Corrigendum of <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0433">DR433.</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>It is noted that with these changes that K.3.5.1.2 <code>tmpname_s</code> will have wording inconsistent with respect to these modifications.</li>
<li>Consistent wording would be, in K.3.5.1.2p2 replace "less than or equal to RSIZE_MAX" with "not greater than RSIZE_MAX".</li>

<h2>Issue 0429: Should <code>gets_s</code> discard next input line when <code>(s == NULL)</code> ?</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>gets_s Annex K.3.5.4.1p2 says:</p>
<p>"If there is a runtime-constraint violation, s[0] is set to the null<br />
character, and characters are read and discarded from stdin until a<br />
new-line character is read, or end-of-file or a read error occurs."</p>
<p>The runtime-constraint violation here can be caused by a null "s"<br />
pointer.  Should we discard the next input line even if <code>(s == NULL)</code> ?</p>
<p>The way it is written, it looks like the answer is yes.  However it is<br />

<ul>
<li>Given that footnote 404 already provides guidance on this issue, the author and the committee agree that the answer to the question posed is indeed yes.</li>
<li>The other issue with respect to <code>s[0]</code> cannot be set to the null character when <code>s==NULL</code> has been determined to be resolved by the following changes.</li>

<p>In Annex K.3.5.4.1, replace paragraph 3 with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a runtime-constraint violation, characters are read and discarded
from <code>stdin</code> until a new-line character is read, or end-of-file or a read error

<h2>Issue 0430: <code>getenv_s</code>, <code>maxsize</code> should be allowed to be zero</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Douglas Walls<br />
Date: 2013-02-11<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1674.htm">N1674</a><br />
Status: Fixed<br />
Fixed in: C17<br />
Converted from: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2396.htm">n2396.htm</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>getenv_s, Annex K.3.6.2.1p2 under Runtime-constraints says:</p>
<p><strong>name</strong> shall not be a null pointer. <strong>maxsize</strong> shall neither equal zero nor
be greater than<br />
<strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>. If <strong>maxsize</strong> is not equal to zero, then <strong>value</strong> shall not
be a null pointer.</p>
<p>Question here is, if maxsize really cannot be 0.  If it cannot be<br />
zero, why does the 2nd sentence mention the condition that <code>(maxsize != 0)</code>?</p>
<p>If maxsize can be 0, it would allow the value to be a null pointer<br />
which allows what is described in 6.6.2.1 of TR24731 (N1173) cleanly:</p>
<p>The <strong>getenv_s</strong> function can also be used to get the size needed to<br />
represent the result. This allows the programmer to first call<br />
<strong>getenv_s</strong> to get the size, then allocate a buffer to hold the result,<br />
and then call <strong>getenv_s</strong> again to actually obtain the result."</p>
<p>if maxsize can be zero, then I think we would get the length of string thusly:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span>getenv_s(<span style="color: #666666">&amp;</span>len,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000">NULL</span>,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span>,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;HOME&quot;</span>);
</pre></div>

<p>However, since maxsize cannot be 0 which also requires value not to be<br />
a null pointer, we would need to do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span>getenv_s(<span style="color: #666666">&amp;</span>len,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>something,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">1</span>,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;HOME&quot;</span>);
</pre></div>

<p>AFAICT, getnenv_s as specified in C11 exactly matches what was in TR24731
(N1172).<br />
What is in TR24731 (N1172) does not coincide with what is in the rational<br />
for TR24731 (N1173).  The wording in TR24731 (N1172) (and by extension<br />
C11) is awkward and it certainly looks like an update intended to correspond to<br />
the rational for TR24731 (N1173) was either misapplied or not applied.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Replace Annex K.3.6.2.1p2 second sentence with:</p>
<p><strong>maxsize</strong> shall not be greater than <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>.</p>
<p>K.3.6.2.1p2 would then read thusly:</p>
<p><strong>name</strong> shall not be a null pointer.  <strong>maxsize</strong> shall not be greater than<br />
<strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>.  If <strong>maxsize</strong> is not equal to zero, then <strong>value</strong> shall not
be a null pointer.</p>

<h2>Issue 0431: <code>atomic_compare_exchange</code>: What does it mean to say two structs compare equal?</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>7.17.7.4 The atomic_compare_exchange generic functions</p>
<p>7.17.7.4p2 Description</p>
<p>Atomically, compares the value pointed to by <strong>object</strong> for equality with<br />
that in <strong>expected</strong>, and if true, replaces the value pointed to by <strong>object</strong><br />
with <strong>desired</strong>, and if false, updates the value in expected with the<br />
value pointed to by <strong>object</strong>.</p>
<p>When <strong>object</strong> is an atomic struct type and <strong>expected</strong> is the corresponding<br />
non-atomic struct type.  What does it mean to compare two struct types<br />
as equal?</p>
<p>Where does the C standard define what it means for two objects of struct<br />
type to be equal?</p>
<p>7.17.7.4 NOTE 1 gives an example using memcmp on how the test for<br />
equality might be defined.  But that is non-normative.</p>
<p>But the padding bytes in a struct have unspecified values (6.2.6.1p6)</p>
<p>7.24.4.1 The memcmp function, footnote 310 reminds us that the contents<br />
of padding in a struct is indeterminate.</p>
<p>Even integers can have padding bits, whose values are unspecified (6.2.6.2p1)</p>
<p>A similar issue probably occurs for Atomic union types.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Either define equality of objects of struct type, add a restriction disallowing<br />
use of atomic structs as arguments for the atomic_compare_exchange generic
functions,<br />
or note that atomic_compare_exchange generic functions for objects of atomic<br />
struct type results in undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Comment from WG14 on 2017-11-03:</p>
<p>Apr 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no sentiment to define equality for structs.</li>
<li>7.17.6 lists atomic types required to have the same size and alignment as the corresponding direct type. Other atomic types may have differing size and alignment as per 6.2.5p27.</li>
<li>6.5.2.3p5 states that any access to an atomic struct or union member is undefined behavior and as such so would atomic_compare_exchange since it requires access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are several points that need addressing.</li>
<li>The original intention of the atomics design was to allow <code>memcmp</code> and <code>memcpy</code> (with suitable synchronization) be a common implementation for all _Atomic objects.</li>
<li>This practice, however, would lead to undefined behavior for implementations that have padding bits for integer representations.</li>
<li>For implementations that choose larger representations for some _Atomic types, there would need to be at least one larger type specific implementation of <code>atomic_compare_exchange</code> compared to what might be possible to implement in common for all types. This seems to imply that an implementation must supply something akin to a type generic implementation of <code>atomic_compare_exchange</code>. Type generic macros as applied to _Atomic is the subject of <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0423">DR423.</a></li>
<li>A proposal to address these issues has been solicited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apr 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The proposed resolution from <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1803.htm">N1803</a> was withdrawn since there are implementations choosing to represent atomic non-lock-free types with extra state and hence a larger size.</li>
<li>Structure compare will result in undefined behavior.</li>
<li>A new paper to address this DR has been solicited</li>
</ul>
<p>Oct 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As requested, the paper
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1864.htm">N1864</a> was written
and provided. From our C++ liaison, however, it was learned that corresponding
behavior is well defined and is in use. Further investigation revealed that
<code>atomic_compare_exchange</code> in C++ is and has been explicitly defined to be that
of bit comparison. C11 defines it as value comparison.</p>
<p>It was noted that bit comparison for atomic bool would not give the expected
answer if differing non-zero "true" values were compared. It was also noted that
bit comparison exposes padding bits, whereas lock bits would be required to be
discarded, leading to code that might work on one implementation of an
architecture but fail on another.</p>
<p>A new paper was solicited.</p>

<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>

<h2>Issue 0432: Is <code>0.0</code> required to be a representable value?</h2>

<p>There are many places in C11 that assume a floating-point zero value, e.g., 0.0,
is representable.</p>
<ul>
<li>6.3.1.7 Real and complex #1 has:
<blockquote>
<p>When a value of real type is converted to a complex type, the real part of the

corresponding real type and the imaginary part of the complex result value is a
positive zero or an unsigned zero.</p>

<li>6.7.9 Initialization, #10 (second bullet) has (for static and thread storage initialzation):

<blockquote>
<p>If no conversion could be performed, zero is returned.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Annex F and Annex G, being based upon IEEE-754, require signed floating-point zeros.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many places in C11 that allow for a representable floating-point zero
value.</p>
<ul>
<li>5.2.4.2.2 Characteristics of floating types &lt;float.h&gt; #4 has:
<blockquote>
<p>An implementation may give zero and values that are not floating-point numbers
(such as infinities and NaNs) a sign or may leave them unsigned.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>7.3.3 Branch cuts, #1 and #2 talk about signed zeros.</li>
<li>7.6 Floating-point environment &lt;fenv.h&gt;, #6, lists <strong>FE_DIVBYZERO</strong> (divide-by-zero) as a possible floating-point exception. And, 7.12.1 Treatment of error conditions gives more details.</li>
<li>7.12 Mathematics &lt;math.h&gt; #6 says that zero, subnormal, normal, NaN, and infinite are mutually exclusive kinds of floating-point values. And 7.12.3.1 The fpclassify macro uses those classification macros.</li>
<li>7.12.3.2 The isfinite macro, #2 says that zero is a finite value.</li>
<li>7.12.3.5 The isnormal macro, #2 says that zero is not a normal value.</li>
<li>7.12.*; many of the math functions (atan2, frexp, ilogb, log, log10, log2, logb, pow, lgamma, tgamma, fmod, remainder, remquo, copysign) mention zero as special cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The C Rationale in its discussion of 5.2.4.2.2 has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the floating-point model adopted permits all common representations,
including sign-magnitude and two's-complement, but precludes a logarithmic
implementation.</p>
<p>The C89 Committee also endeavored to accommodate the IEEE 754 floating-point
standard by not adopting any constraints on floating-point which were contrary
to that standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if one carefully reads 5.2.4.2.2 Characteristics of floating types
&lt;float.h&gt;, #2 and #3, one finds that zero is not required to be representable.
As I read those paragraphs, normalized floating-point numbers are the only
things required to be contained in floating types. Subnormal floating-point
numbers, unnormalized floating-point numbers, infinities, and NaNs are
additional (optional) things that may be contained in floating types. Zero is
not mentioned explicitly.</p>
<p>So, it appears that some parts of C11 require that floating-point zeros be
representable, while other parts do not require that they be representable.</p>
<p>I think that the first sentance in 5.2.4.2.2 #3 should be changed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Floating types shall be able to represent normalized floating-point numbers
(f<sub>1</sub> &gt; 0 if x != 0) and (positive or unsigned) zero. In addition,
floating types may be able to contain other kinds of floating-point numbers,
such as negative zero and subnormal ...</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>K.3.7.2.2 The strncat_s function</strong><br />
The <strong>strncat_s()</strong> has a constraint that neither <strong>s1max</strong> nor <strong>n</strong> shall be
greater than <strong>RSIZE_MAX.</strong><br />
Both s1max and n are defined as representing a number of char sized characters.</p>
<p><strong>K.3.9.2.1.2 The wcsncpy_s function</strong><br />
The same constraint is given for the function the <strong>wcsncat_s()</strong> function,
i.e. that neither <strong>s1max</strong> nor <strong>n</strong> shall be greater than <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>.  For
<strong>wcsncat_s(), s1max</strong> and <strong>n</strong> are defined as representing a number of
<strong>wchar_t</strong> sized characters.  On most implementations the size of a wide
characters is many times the size of a char.  On Solaris it is 4 time the size.</p>
<p><strong>K.3.4 Integer types &lt;stdint.h&gt;</strong> is defined as follows<br />
1 The header <strong>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</strong> defines a macro.<br />
2 The macro is</p>
<p><strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong></p>
<p>which expands to a value 386) of type <strong>size_t</strong>. Functions that have
parameters of type <strong>rsize_t</strong> consider it a runtime-constraint violation if
the values of those parameters are greater than <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>.</p>
<p>386) The macro <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> need not expand to a constant expression.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended practice</strong></p>
<p>3 Extremely large object sizes are frequently a sign that an object's size was
calculated incorrectly. For example, negative numbers appear as very large
positive numbers when converted to an unsigned type like size_t. Also, some
implementations do not support objects as large as the maximum value that can be
represented by type size_t.</p>
<p>4 For those reasons, it is sometimes beneficial to restrict the range of object
sizes to detect programming errors. For implementations targeting machines with
large address spaces, it is recommended that <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> be defined as the
smaller of the size of the largest object supported or <strong>(SIZE_MAX &gt;&gt; 1)</strong>,
even if this limit is smaller than the size of some legitimate, but very large,
objects. Implementations targeting machines with small address spaces may wish
to define <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> as <strong>SIZE_MAX</strong>, which means that there is no object
size that is considered a runtime-constraint violation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The recommended practice implies <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> represents maximum object sizes.</p>
<p>Footnote 386) implies an implementation can adjust what <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> expands
to depending upon the context in which it is being used.  But what I don't
understand is how, the user can take advantage of <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> to check the
values of n and s1max prior to calling the function <strong>wcsncpy_s</strong> in order to
avoid violating the runtime constraint error.  There is no context in which the
implementation can expand <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> to the value they need.</p>

<p>Is a conforming implementation allowed  to return a non-zero value for
<strong>wcsncpy_s()</strong> in the example above?</p>
<p>N1147 the Rationale for TR24731 explains implementations might wish to adjust
the value of <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> dynamically, and gives several scenarios for doing
so. None of which seem germane to the questions raised here.</p>
<hr />
<p>So what is the purpose of providing the macro <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>?<br />
If the purpose is to limit all buffer sizes to <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>, it's use in
constraints for wide character functions appear to be malformed.</p>
<p>The definitions of <strong>wcsncpy_s()</strong> and <strong>strncat_s()</strong> have constraints that
treat their arguments that represent character counts as if those counts
represent the size of an object that can be tested against <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong> in the
same way.  But those character counts represent characters of very different
sizes.  And thus very different object sizes.  Maybe the constraint error for
<strong>wcsncpy_s()</strong> arguments <strong>smax1</strong> and <strong>n</strong> should be rewritten as something
like:</p>
<p>Neither <strong>(s1max * sizeof(wchar_t))</strong> nor <strong>(n * sizeof(wchar_t))</strong> shall
be greater than <strong>RSIZE_MAX</strong>.</p>
<p>Other functions where max argument represent the number of<br />
wchar_t or multi-byte characters and may need similar changes<br />

<h2>Issue 0437: <code>clock</code> overflow problems</h2>
<p>Authors: Austin Group, Nick Stoughton (US)<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>C11 (and C99 before it) state for <strong>clock()</strong> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be represented,
the function returns the value (clock_t)(-1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(C11 7.27.2.1 p3). Footnote 319 also states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to measure the time spent in a program, the clock function should be
called at the start of the program and its return value subtracted from the
value returned by subsequent calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The normative requirement implies that if more processor time has passed than
can be fit into a variable of type <strong>clock_t</strong> the function must fail and
return <strong>(clock_t)-1</strong>.</p>
<p>However, existing implementations almost exclusively ignore this requirement and
if more ticks pass than can fit into a <strong>clock_t</strong> the implementation simply
truncates the value and return the lowermost bits of the actual value. In
programming environments where clock_t is a 32-bit integer type and
CLOCKS_PER_SEC is one million (a very common implementation), clock() will
start misreporting in less than 36 minutes of processor time for signed
clock_t, or 72 minutes for unsigned clock_t.</p>
<p><em>Question 1:</em> Are such implementations conforming? If not, should the standard
be altered in any way to permit this <em>de-facto</em> standard implementation?</p>
<p><em>Question 2:</em> Should the standard define some limit macros for clock_t
(effectively defining new values in limits.h for CLOCK_MAX, the minimum maximum
value for a clock_t)?</p>
<p><em>Question 3:</em> If the value is truncated and clock_t is a signed type, the
recommended application usage n footnote 319 (subtracting clock_t values to
measure intervals) can cause the application to invoke undefined behavior via
integer overflow. In particular, if the initial call to clock() returned A &gt; 0
(by virtue of some processor time having been consumed before the start of
main() or the point of first measurement), and a subsequent call returned
B=INT_MIN just after overflow, then the recommended practice of computing B-A
invokes undefined behavior. Should there be any warning of this included in the
footnote?</p>
<h3>Suggested Change</h3>
<p>Given that the vast majority of surveyed implementations appear to have
implemented clock with a simple incrementing counter with no check for overflow,
the requirement for <strong>clock()</strong> to return <strong>(clock_t)-1</strong> when the number of
clock ticks cannot be represented in a variable of type clock_t should be
relaxed:</p>
<p>At 7.27.2.1 paragraph 3, change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be represented,
the function returns the value (clock_t)(-1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the processor time used is not available, the function returns the value
(clock_t)-1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(thus leaving the behavior on overflow unspecified). Change footnote 319 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to measure the time spent in a program, the clock function should be
called at the start of the program and its return value subtracted from the
value returned by subsequent calls. Note, however, that such a subtraction may
result in undefined behavior if clock_t is an unsigned integer type.</p>

<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>This issue is tied to Austin Group Defect #686.</li>
<li>The committee feels that the core issue regards required behavior under the condition that overflow occurs in the implementations choice for the representation of <code>clock_t</code>.</li>
<li>It is noted that many and possibly most implementations have chosen an integer <code>clock_t</code> size that overflows early and often.</li>
<li>The standard does seem to require that the overflow condition is detected and that the corresponding return value shall be that of failure <code>(clock_t)-1</code>.</li>
<li>Such detection runs counter to the desired behavior of the clock counter as being that of highest implementation efficiency, and to subsequent uses across durations that do not exhibit overflow after the first occurrence.</li>
<li>The suggested technical corrigendum does not appear to discuss or address this core issue and warrants further discussion. The following suggestion for the footnote is offered:
<blockquote>
<p>Implementations commonly use an integer <code>clock_t</code> type that can overflow in as
little as 36 minutes. All uses of <code>clock()</code> to measure a duration of time must
address the issue of possible overflow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The paper <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1895.htm">N1895</a>

<code>clock_t</code> is underspecified and that this function should be deprecated and
replaced in a revision to the standard with something that uses, perhaps,
<code>struct timespec</code>. In particular, no implementations are known to implement the
<code>-1</code> return value on overflow.</p>
<p>The committee reviewed the following words and approved them as the Proposed
Technical Corrigendum.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To question 1, such programs are not conforming and, no, the standard should not
be altered to accept this behavior.</p>
<p>To question 2, no, this is not the direction.</p>
<p>To question 3, the committee does not agree that this invokes undefined
behavior. The value returned under such conditions is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In 7.27.2.1p3 change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be represented,
the function returns the value <code>(clock_t)(-1)</code><sup>319</sup>. ...</p>
<p>319) In order to measure the time spent in a program, the <code>clock</code> function
should be called at the start of the program and its return value subtracted
from the value returned by subsequent calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the processor time used is not available, the function returns the value
<code>(clock_t)(-1)</code>. If the value cannot be represented, the function returns an
unspecified value<sup>319</sup>. ...</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>C11 (and C99 before it) state for both <strong>ungetc()</strong> and <strong>ungetwc()</strong> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by stream) to a file

</blockquote>
<p>(7.21.7.10 p2 &amp; p5, with similar at 7.29.3.10 p2 &amp; p5). The "or discarding"
phrasing in p5 makes no sense: all of the listed functions which discard the

whatever the function sets it to, not "the same as it was before the characters
were pushed back".</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>This issue arises because of the different architectures of a buffered stream which can hold pushed back characters, and that of the underlying filesystem which honors seek independent of the buffering.</li>
<li>The committee sentiment is that the suggested changes are nearly correct and have requested that the project editor suggest better wording, subject to further discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apr 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Standard is correct as written because the intent is that the specified file
position indicator is an intermediate state inside the file positioning function
after the pushed-back characters are discarded but before the actual seek. That
gives you a reliable file position from which to do the seek. It's not intended
that the file positioning function doesn't set the file position indicator.</p>

<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>

<h2>Issue 0439: Issues with the definition of “full expression”</h2>

Date: 2013-07-16<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have discovered several issues in 6.8p4, which defines “full expression” and
points out the major implications for an expression that is a full expression.
In this paper I present the issues, along with my recommendations. For the
issues for which it makes sense, I will later submit defect reports.</p>
<p>Here is the text of 6.8p4, with clause numbering added for convenience of
reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A <em>full expression</em> is an expression that is not part of another expression or of a declarator.</li>
<li>Each of the following is a full expression:
<ol>
<li>an initializer that is not part of a compound literal;</li>
<li>the expression in an expression statement;</li>
<li>the controlling expression of a selection statement (if or switch);</li>
<li>the controlling expression of a while or do statement;</li>
<li>each of the (optional) expressions of a for statement;</li>
<li>the (optional) expression in a return statement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There is a sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression and the evaluation of the next full expression to be evaluated.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are the issues.</p>
<p>A. The phrase “not part of another expression or of a declarator” (sentence 1)
is rather difficult to understand. It <em>probably</em> means: not part of another
expression, nor part of a declarator. (But DeMorgan's law is hard on the brain.)</p>
<p>I believe this could be fixed as a simple editorial issue.</p>
<p>B. The status of an initializer expression depends on whether the context is a
declaration or a compound literal (clause 2.1). That would seem to imply
different sequencing guarantees in those contexts. As it turns out, it does, but
the implication is quite subtle. Consider 6.7.9p23:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evaluations of the initialization list expressions are indeterminately
sequenced with respect to one another and thus the order in which any side
effects occur is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And consider this example:</p>

<p>In every use of the <code>INITIALIZERS</code> macro, the variable <code>i</code> is incremented three
times. In cases 1 and 2, there is no undefined behavior, because the increments
are in expressions that are indeterminately sequenced with respect to one
another, not unsequenced. There is no guarantee in what order the evaluations
are done, so there is no guarantee in what order they will appear, but the
initial values are guaranteed to be <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code> and <code>'2'</code>.</p>
<p>(It's not perfectly clear whether that guarantee was provided by C99, which
instead said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The order in which any side effects occur among the initialization list
expressions is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any event, as a data point, that guarantee was not honored by GCC until
release 4.6, in 2011.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, because case 3 contains an unsequenced evaluation of <code>i</code> in
the same full expression, it has undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Considering the number of hours it took me to finally reach this conclusion, I
thought it would be worthwhile to bring it to the full committee to make sure
everyone understands and agrees with it. If so, an addition to the rationale
might be in order.</p>
<p>C. Consider 6.7.6p3 (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>full declarator</em> is a declarator that is not part of another declarator.
<strong>The end of a full declarator is a sequence point.</strong> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also 6.2.4p8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A non-lvalue expression with structure or union type, where the structure or
union contains a member with array type (including, recursively, members of all
contained structures and unions) refers to an object with automatic storage
duration and <em>temporary lifetime</em>.<sup>36)</sup> Its lifetime begins when the
expression is evaluated and its initial value is the value of the expression.
Its lifetime ends <strong>when the evaluation of the containing full expression or
full declarator ends</strong>. Any attempt to modify an object with temporary lifetime
results in undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from these passages that the sequence of evaluations includes not
only full expressions, but also full declarators – whatever sense it makes to
talk about “evaluating” a full declarator. But sentence 3 does not acknowledge
that reality.</p>
<p>My inclination is to adopt a bit of terminology from Ada, and start talking
about the “elaboration” of a declarator, which, for a variably modified type,
involves the run-time evaluation of array sizes, and then to re-draft sentence 3
and the other paragraphs cited here, to make it clear that sequence points
separate elaborations of full declarators as well as evaluations of full
expressions. In any event, I think there's a problem in sentence 3 that needs to
be fixed.</p>
<p>D. Expressions in abstract declarators are not mentioned at all (compare to
sentence 1). The logical inference is that such an expression is not a full
expression by itself, but part of the containing full expression. But there are
cases where there is no containing full expression. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">typedef</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">_Atomic</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #666666">*</span>)[rand()])<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>T;

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">_Alignas</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>[rand()])<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>i;
</pre></div>

<p>In these examples, not only is there no containing full expression, there isn't
even any containing full declarator, because these expressions appear in the
declaration specifiers, not the declarator.</p>
<p>Probably the simplest approach here would be to disallow variably modified types
with <code>_Atomic</code> and <code>_Alignas</code>, at least until the next revision of the standard.</p>
<p>E. The list of full expression contexts (sentence 2) is not logically complete.
According to the definition (sentence 1), an expression appearing in a
constant-expression context is (often) a full expression. Of course there are no
sequencing implications relevant for constant expressions, but it's not clear
that makes it important for a constant expression not to be counted as a full
expression. In any event, it's not clear how the list normatively interacts with
the definition.</p>
<p>I think we should consider moving the list into a note, so it's clear that the
definition is, well, definitive. The note could also point out that sequencing
is irrelevant to constant expressions.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>These are subtle issues upon which the committee wishes to continue discussing.</li>
<li>The committee is seeking concurrence with the project editor that Point A may be viewed as editorial.</li>
<li>To Point B the committee is in agreement that there is a "guarantee" of the distinct values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>, and that this is not new to C11. The committee requires further discussion as to whether and how these subtleties could be expressed in a non-normative fashion, such as "in the rationale", "in a footnote", or simply as an example.</li>
<li>To Point C the committee agrees that some change is needed and has solicited a suggested resolution from the author. The fact that VLAs can have several dimensions and hence several expressions gave pause to all.</li>
<li>To Point D the committee agrees that this has been left undefined and deserves a committee response but no normative or other change.</li>
<li>To Point E, the committee agreed that the list of full expressions named in 6.8 paragraph 4 second sentence should likely be regarded as non-normative rather than allowing it to appear exhaustive. To achieve this, the list could be transformed into a note or footnote.</li>

<li>The Part D section had already met with some some skepticism from the committee and was mostly provided as an idea to consider.

Another new paper on this point would be welcomed by the committee.</li>
<li>The sequencing issues raise in Part B are subtle and the Standard potentially confusing, but there is no reported evidence that this is causing any issues in practice.

<p>Change 6.8p4 from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>full expression</em> is an expression that is not part of another expression, or
of a declarator. Each of the following is a full expression: an initializer that
is not part of a compound literal; the expression in an expression statement;
the controlling expression of a selection statement (<code>if</code> or <code>switch)</code>; the
controlling expression of a <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> statement; each of the (optional)
expressions of a <code>for</code> statement; the (optional) expression in a <code>return</code>
statement. There is a sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression
and the evaluation of the next full expression to be evaluated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>full expression</em> is an expression that is not part of another expression, nor
part of a declarator or abstract declarator. There is also an implicit full

size expressions are unsequenced with respect to one another. There is a
sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression and the evaluation of
the next full expression to be evaluated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add after 6.8p4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Each of the following is a full expression:</p>

<h2>Issue 0440: Floating-point issues in C11 from PDTS 18661-1 UK review, Issue 1</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Some issues with floating point in C11 have been identified as part of the UK
review of the N1711 draft of TS 18661-1. While such issues relate to the general
area of C bindings to IEC 60559:2011, and so could be addressed in the TS on
that basis, since the issues also apply to C11 as-is it may be more appropriate
to address some or all of these issues as Defect Reports with a view to having a
normative fix in a future TC to C11 rather than only having a fix in conjunction
with the new bindings.</p>
<p>Issue 1: Choice of long double in Annex F</p>
<p>Annex F provides various choices for the long double type (which may or may not
be an IEC 60559 type), but no method is provided for an application to determine
which choice has been made.</p>
<p>If a macro is provided to say whether the type is an IEC 60559 type, all the
other properties can be determined from the existing &lt;float.h&gt; macros. So, a
sufficient fix would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2, insert a new paragraph after paragraph 10: Whether a type matches
an IEC 60559 type is characterized by the implementation-defined values of
FLT_IS_IEC_60559, DBL_IS_IEC_60559, and LDBL_IS_IEC_60559:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 type does not match an IEC 60559 format</li>
<li>1 type's values and operations are those of an IEC 60559 basic, interchange or extended type</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To do as suggested, distinguish whether <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>long double</code> are
IEC or not, requires the addition of new macros, which is a feature, which is
not allowed by the mechanism of defect reports.</p>
<p>The defect originator notes that the underlying issue that needs consideration
in any further comprehensive publication of the Standard is that all
implementation defined behaviors need to be strictly called out in the Standard,
and moreover that they be done so in a manner that is accessible to a client of
the implementation to allow proper choice of algorithms. It has been asserted
that leaving implementation defined behaviors formally undefined in the Standard
has led to significant and unnecessary divergences in implementations.</p>

<p>Issue 2: Definition of FLT_ROUNDS</p>
<p>The C11 definition of FLT_ROUNDS is inadequate in that it refers to
floating-point addition but does not say addition of what type. If long double
is not an IEC 60559 type, it may not fully support all rounding modes even
though they are supported by other types. (This is an actual issue with real
implementations using non-IEC 60559 types for long double.) A suitable fix would
be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#8, insert "for type float" after "floating-point addition". At the
end of F.2#1, insert "The value of FLT_ROUNDS applies to all IEC 60559 types
supported by the implementation, but may not apply to non-IEC 60559 types.".</p>

<p>Oct 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Proposed Committee Response was revised for accuracy and more detailed
information, and is provided below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Proposed Committee Response (obsolete)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee regards the existing definition of <code>FLT_ROUNDS</code> as intended to
apply to types <code>float</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code>. However, if all three types
cannot support the same set of rounding modes, the implementation needs to set
<code>FLT_ROUNDS</code> to -1 meaning indeterminable.</p>
<p>As has been pointed out, in Annex F, only the types float and double need be IEC
60559 types. If long double is not an IEC 60559 type (for example, a pair of
doubles), it may not support the same set of rounding modes as float and double.
In this case, having <code>FLT_ROUNDS</code> apply to float and double (but not long
double) would result in a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3 and would provide new and
useful information to the programmer.</p>
<p>However, this behavioral change could also break existing programs, and as such
the committee prefers to leave as is for this revision of the Standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apr 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Proposed Committee Response was revised yet again based on the input that
since FLT_ROUNDS in existing practice is universally coded as 1, the proposed
changes won’t affect existing practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The implementation of <code>long double</code>, for example, may significantly differ from
IEC floating types and may not support the same choices as would otherwise be
possible for <code>FLT_ROUNDS</code>. All known implementations define <code>FLT_ROUNDS</code> as the
value <code>1</code> (round to nearest). and as such exempting non-IEC <code>long double</code>
behavior allows the potential for implementations to provide the full range of
possible values for IEC floating types.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>At the end of F.2#1, insert</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of FLT_ROUNDS applies to all IEC 60559 types supported by the
implementation, but need not apply to non-IEC 60559 types.</p>

<p>Issue 3: Floating-point exceptions and 6.5#5</p>
<p>C11 6.5#5 says "If an exceptional condition occurs during the evaluation of an
expression (that is, if the result is not mathematically defined or not in the
range of representable values for its type), the behavior is undefined.". When
the Annex F bindings are in effect, it must be intended that floating-point
exceptions do not produce such undefined behavior (instead, behavior such as
evaluating to a NaN must be defined). But no normative text actually says that.</p>
<p>A suitable fix would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Append to 6.5#5: For implementations defining __STDC_IEC_559__, this does
not apply to exceptional conditions where the behavior (such as raising a
floating-point exception and returning a NaN) is defined by Annex F, directly or
by reference to IEC 60559.</p>

<li>The following words were discussed extensively and thought appropriate as appropriate for inclusion in F.3, rather than a new F.4:

<p>If an exceptional condition occurs during the evaluation of an expression (that
is, if the result is not mathematically defined or not in the range of
representable values for its type), and the behaviour is not defined in this
annex or by reference to IEC 60559, 6.5p5 applies and the behaviour is
undefined.</p>

<p>Further correspondence with the author and excerpted in
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1804.htm">N1804</a> has

</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>WG14 treats normative annexes such as Annex F as if they were linear extensions
of the standard itself. When Annex F is requested via definition of
<code>__STDC_IEC_559__</code> then 6.5#5 is superseded and floating point exceptions become
well defined.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Some issues with floating point in C11 have been identified as part of the UK
review of the N1711 draft of TS 18661-1. While such issues relate to the general
area of C bindings to IEC 60559:2011, and so could be addressed in the TS on
that basis, since the issues also apply to C11 as-is it may be more appropriate
to address some or all of these issues as Defect Reports with a view to having a
normative fix in a future TC to C11 rather than only having a fix in conjunction
with the new bindings.</p>
<p>Issue 4: Floating-point state not being an object</p>
<p>The description of the floating-point environment in C11 fails to make
sufficiently clear what is or is not an object (C11 footnote 205 is not
normative, and so cannot be used to that effect); it uses terms such as "system
variable" without saying what that is. Simply moving that footnote to normative
text would fix this issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move the contents of footnote 205 (C11 subclause 7.6) to the end of 5.1.2.3#2.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Comment from WG14 on 2015-04-17:</p>
<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The committee agrees that the floating point environment is not an object and must be stated in normative terms instead of in non-normative footnote 205.</li>
<li>The environment may be modified more than once in an expression without inducing undefined behavior, this is just "how it works".</li>
<li>The floating-point environment is described in the standard using an otherwise undefined term "system variable" having 7.6p2 thread storage duration, implying that it is an object, and so this is perhaps the actual manifestation of the defect that requires correction.</li>
<li>The floating-point environment is technically an actor, not an object, having a model of its behavior defined purely by messages as its internal "piece of state" is not directly visible. In this case the messages are the macros and functions, as are the electronic signals from the floating-point computational units to consult and honor the desired floating point modal behaviors, and the electronic signals that record "auxiliary information" in the model for floating point exceptions.</li>
<li>In any case, the floating point environment implementation is not described by the abstract C machine, only its operations.</li>
<li>The committee prefers that this be cleared up in 7.6, by moving the second sentence and possibly the first sentence into normative text.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issue 0444: Issues with alignment in C11, part 1</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>There are various deficiencies in the C11 text about alignment requirements.</p>
<p>Issue 1: Existence of over-aligned types</p>
<p>6.2.8#3 defines the concept of an over-aligned type, with a footnote saying
"Every over-aligned type is, or contains, a structure or union type with a
member to which an extended alignment has been applied.". But there is no way in
the syntax to apply such an alignment to a member. _Alignas appears in the
syntax for alignment-specifier, which in turn appears in that for
declaration-specifiers (6.7#1). But structure and union members instead use
struct-declaration which uses specifier-qualifier-list which doesn't include a
case for alignment-specifier at all. So for the reference to over-aligned types,
and the reference in 6.7.5#6 to the "declared object or member", to be
meaningful, something needs adding to the syntax for struct-declaration. (Note
that specifier-qualifier-list is also used in the syntax for type-name, and it
seems less likely that a type-name was intended to be able to include
alignment-specifiers.)</p>

<p>Comment from WG14 on 2017-11-03:</p>
<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The desired and intended syntax is indeed missing.</li>
<li>Whereas one could achieve the desired effect by placing the directive on the aggregate itself and controlling it by the maximum alignment of each of its members, this is far from the intended goal, and we do consider this a defect.</li>
<li>We solicit a suggested technical corrigendum from the author.</li>
<li>Modifying the definition of type name will require considerable thought.</li>
<li>Applying the directive beyond aggregate members, such as a simple scalar declaration, is not well defined, and brings in the various storage durations and how or whether all or any are supported.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Apr 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The author provided the following technical corrigendum as input to <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1804.htm">N1804</a>:<br />
6.7.2.1#1: Move the definition of specifier-qualifier-list to 6.7.7#1. Insert a new definition in 6.7.2.1#1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>specifier-qualifier-alignment-list:</p>
<p>type-specifier specifier-qualifier-alignment-list_opt<br />
type-qualifier specifier-qualifier-alignment-list_opt<br />
alignment-specifier specifier-qualifier-alignment-list_opt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change the use of specifier-qualifier-list in the syntax for struct-declaration
to specifier-qualifier-alignment-list.</p>
<p>6.7.2#2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change "and in the specifier-qualifier list in each struct declaration and type
name" to ", in the specifier-qualifier-alignment list in each struct declaration
and in the specifier-qualifier list in each type name".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.7.3#5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change "specifier-qualifier-list" to "specifier-qualifier-list,
specifier-qualifier-alignment-list or declaration-specifiers" (twice).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(That the wording about duplicate qualifiers and qualifiers used with _Atomic doesn't deal with declaration-specifiers, the syntax production relevant to normal declarations, is a pre-existing problem noticed in the course of preparing this wording.)</p>
<p>(I believe all the semantics and constraints required for alignment specifiers
on members are in place, including 6.2.7#1 dealing with cross-translation-unit
type compatibility and references to bit-fields and members in 6.7.5.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee agrees with this as the proper direction and will solicit further review from implementors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oct 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There still has not been adequate review of these changes. The Project Editor
and others have been asked to examine these changes closely prior to our next
meeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apr 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The suggested syntax provided by the author has been adopted on a trial basis in
at least one implementation. It does not, however, provide for compound
literals.</p>
<p>A simpler syntax change was discussed, to wit</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>specifier-qualifier-list</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>type-specifier specifier-qualifier-list<sub>opt</sub></em></p>
<p><em>type-qualifier specifier-qualifier-list<sub>opt</sub></em></p>
<p><ins><em>alignment-specifier specifier-qualifier-list<sub>opt</sub></em></ins></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>specifier-qualifier-list</em> is used in the grammar in only two productions:
<em>struct-declaration</em> (which relates to the primary purpose of this DR), and
<em>type-name</em>, which is used only in the definitions of these constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li>generic association (generic selection)</li>
<li>compound literal</li>
<li><code>sizeof</code> expression</li>
<li><code>_Alignof</code> expression</li>
<li>cast expression</li>
<li>atomic type specifier</li>
<li>alignment specifier</li>
</ul>
<p>A constraint could be added to 6.7.7 <em>type-name</em> after paragraph 1 disallowing
the use of <em>alignment-specifier</em> in a <em>type-name</em> except in the case of
<em>compound literal</em> which was deemed useful by the committee. The following
principles were elucidated:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>_Alignas</code> needs to be applied wherever objects are laid out in memory. On modern architectures page and cache line alignment of data structures is increasingly critical for performance.</li>
<li>Alignment is incorporated into the type system for structure (and union) members, but otherwise is not considered part of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 6.7.3p5, there are two references to <em>specifier-qualifier-list</em>, which should
also reference declaration specifiers.</p>
<p>In 6.7.5 paragraphs 2 and 4, there are occurrences of the phrase “alignment
attribute” which should instead read “alignment specifier”</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>There are various deficiencies in the C11 text about alignment requirements.</p>
<p>Issue 2: Contexts in which alignments are supported</p>
<p>6.2.8#2 defines "fundamental alignment": "A fundamental alignment is represented
by an alignment less than or equal to the greatest alignment supported by the
implementation in all contexts, which is equal to _Alignof (max_align_t)."</p>
<p>6.2.8#3 defines "extended alignment": "An extended alignment is represented by
an alignment greater than _Alignof (max_align_t). It is
implementation-defined whether any extended alignments are supported and the
contexts in which they are supported. A type having an extended alignment
requirement is an over-aligned type."</p>
<p>6.2.8#4 defines "valid alignment", saying "Alignments are represented as values
of the type size_t. Valid alignments include only those values returned by an
_Alignof expression for fundamental types, plus an additional
implementation-defined set of values, which may be empty. Every valid alignment
value shall be a nonnegative integral power of two.".</p>
<p>max_align_t is specified in 7.19#2 as "an object type whose alignment is as
great as is supported by the implementation in all contexts".</p>
<p>The memory management functions in 7.22.3 are defined to return a pointer
"suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object
with a fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
or an array of such objects in the space allocated". In the case of
aligned_alloc, there may be a stricter requirement given by the alignment
passed to the function, but the alignment passed to the function can't result in
memory any less-aligned than a fundamental alignment requirement. The alignment
requirement still applies even if the size is too small for any object requiring
the given alignment (see the response to C90 DR#075).</p>
<p>There are various problems with the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The term "fundamental type" is not defined in C11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also no definition of what a "context" is in which an alignment might or might not be supported. In common implementation practice, separate contexts might be by the storage duration of the object (static, thread, automatic, allocated, with the last referring to the alignments guaranteed by calloc, malloc and realloc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "valid alignment" may not be a "fundamental alignment". Thus, whatever interpretation is adopted for "fundamental type", nothing in the standard requires the alignment of a "fundamental type" to be a "fundamental alignment". For example, say "long double" is a "fundamental type"; it would seem nonsensical if declaring "long double" objects (in any context) failed to work, but nothing seems to require malloc to return objects sufficiently aligned for long double.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given these gaps in the definition, nothing in the normative text appears to imply footnote 57 "Every over-aligned type is, or contains, a structure or union type with a member to which an extended alignment has been applied.", although no doubt it reflects the intent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If "fundamental type" is interpreted to mean "basic type", that is not sufficient to resolve these lacunae. For example, if</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">s</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">long</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>ld;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>}
</pre></div>

<p>has an alignment requirement bigger than long double, it should still be
possible to allocate memory for it with malloc, and the same applies to any
typedef from a standard header that might also have a bigger alignment
requirement than any basic type.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following principles seem natural for any fix for this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>C99 referred to "any type of object" in the alignment requirements for calloc, malloc and realloc. As a matter of compatibility, this means that any type that could be constructed within C99 (including one using types from standard headers) should have an alignment required by C11 to be supported in all contexts, and the same applies to types from C extensions originally specified as extensions to C99. Most of the following principles follow to a greater or lesser extent from this compatibility principle.</li>
<li>All basic types have alignments supported in all contexts.</li>
<li>All enumerated types have alignments supported in all contexts.</li>
<li>All pointer types have alignments supported in all contexts (even if the type pointed to does not).</li>
<li>All types from standard headers specified as complete object types in the definitions of those headers have alignments supported in all contexts. (This includes both types specified as typedefs and types specified as structs or unions with a given tag.)</li>
<li>If a type has an alignment supported in all contexts, so do arrays of that type, qualified versions of that type, and atomic versions of that type.</li>
<li>If all the members of a structure or union have types with alignments supported in all contexts, and none of them use an _Alignas specifier specifying an alignment bigger than supported in all contexts, then that structure or union has an alignment supported in all contexts.</li>
<li>Where C extensions such as TS 18661-2 and 18661-3 are proposed that define new types, or existing such extensions such as TR 18037 are revised and updated for C11, care should be taken that the new types are covered under the above, whether through being basic types or through being defined in standard headers. (If SIMD vector types, as mentioned at <a href="https://www.open-std.org/pipermail/cplex/2013-June/000010.html">http://www.open-std.org/pipermail/cplex/2013-June/000010.html</a>, were to end up in any such extension, it would probably be appropriate to define them in a way that does *not* require calloc, malloc and realloc to return memory suitably aligned for them; such types often require alignments bigger than needed for any other type, so imposing such requirements on memory allocation functions would result in undue inefficiency.)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Comment from WG14 on 2017-11-03:</p>
<p>Oct 2013 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is indeed the case that 6.2.8p3 "fundamental type" is not defined. The intention is that it be "basic type", such that "fundamental alignment" is well defined, and yet this is not the case, and "fundamental alignment" also needs a definition. It is likely that the definition of fundamental type can be made editorially, but that when and where fundamental alignment is required is substantive.</li>
<li>It is also the case that 6.2.8p3 "contexts" is not defined. It is intended to mean the full set of storage durations. Perhaps we should say "storage duration contexts".</li>
<li>It is also the case that "valid alignment" may not be a "fundamental alignment".</li>
<li>It was the case in C99 that <code>malloc</code> was required to return memory appropriate for "any type", and this should not be lost in the new wording regarding types that are not over-aligned. All other C99 behaviors must also be preserved as he describes as guidance.</li>
<li>All types declared without the _Alignas directive are intended to have fundamental alignment, which must be tied somehow to basic type. A consequence is that the only manner in which one can produce an over-aligned type is through _Alignas. <code>malloc</code> has been defined in terms of fundamental alignment, yet we do not anywhere strongly state that, say, <code>int</code> has such fundamental alignment.</li>
<li>These are several interwoven definitions and missing definitions that need a comprehensive review for adequate correction. We solicit the author for a suggested technical corrigendum. A copy of the audio discussion can be provided.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The author provided input to <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1804.htm">N1804</a> as a proposed technical corrigendum:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change 6.2.8#2 to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fundamental alignment is a valid alignment less than or equal to <code>_Alignof (max_align_t)</code>. Fundamental alignments shall be supported by the implementation
for objects of all storage durations. The alignment requirements of the
following types shall be fundamental alignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>all atomic, qualified or unqualified basic types;</li>
<li>all atomic, qualified or unqualified enumerated types;</li>
<li>all atomic, qualified or unqualified pointer types;</li>
<li>all array types whose element type has a fundamental alignment requirement;</li>
<li>all types specified in clause 7 as complete object types;</li>
<li>all structure or union types all of whose elements have types with fundamental alignment requirements and none of whose elements have an alignment specifier specifying an alignment that is not a fundamental alignment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In 6.2.8#3, change "the contexts in" to "the storage durations of objects for
which".</p>
<p>In 6.2.8#4, change "those values returned by an _Alignof expression for
fundamental types" to "fundamental alignments".</p>
<p>(Note that the above admits the possibility that e.g. 1 and 4 are fundamental
alignments, but 2 isn't, in which case it can't be an extended alignment either.
If we want to ensure that 2 isn't a valid alignment at all in that case, rather
than possibly having valid alignments that are neither fundamental nor extended,
also change "additional implementation-defined set of values" to "additional
implementation-defined set of extended alignments" in 6.2.8#4.) In 6.7.5#3,
change "in the context in which it appears" to "for an object of the storage
duration, if any, being declared". Add a new constraint at the end of 6.7.5#3:
"An object shall not be declared with an over-aligned type with an extended
alignment requirement not supported by the implementation for an object of that
storage duration.".</p>
<p>(This deals with the point that if an over-aligned struct is defined, then
objects with that type may be supported with some storage durations but not
others, so it is the declaration of an object with that type that can violate a
constraint rather than the declaration of the struct.)</p>
<p>In 7.19#2, change "whose alignment is as great as is supported by the
implementation in all contexts" to "whose alignment is the greatest fundamental
alignment".</p>
<p>(I'm trying to avoid an undesirable implication that if an alignment of e.g. 1MB
is supported in all contexts - and it's quite plausible that an implementation
can support more or less arbitrary alignments - then max_align_t must have
such an alignment and so such an alignment must count as fundamental and so
malloc must return memory suitable aligned for it.)</p>

<p>This is a difficult area and further study is required.</p>

<h2>Issue 0446: Use byte instead of character for memcmp, memcpy</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Blaine Garst<br />
Date: 2013-07-31<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It has been noted that the descriptions for 7.24.2.1 <code>memcpy</code>, 7.24.2.2
<code>memmove</code> and 7.24.4.1 <code>memcmp</code> are written using the term <em>character</em> which is
inconsistent with their design as <em>memory</em> functions. Moreover, if one then
reads 3.7.2 as allowing character to mean multibyte character, it is thought
that confusion could arise as to whether the number of multibyte characters
should be supplied rather than the number of bytes.</p>
<p>Although it is clear by 7.24.1 <em>String function conventions</em> paragraph 3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all functions in this sub clause, each character shall be interpreted as if
it had the type <code>unsigned char</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>that the number of bytes to be used corresponds to the size of a <code>unsigned char</code>, one has to reference 6.2.6 <em>Representation of types</em> to learn that
<code>unsigned char</code> is in fact a single byte (consisting of <code>CHAR_BIT</code> bits).</p>
<p>It would be simpler and more to the point if the three memory functions describe
their count parameter <code>n</code> in terms of bytes.</p>

<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After reviewing the original motivation and suggestion for change, it was noted
by the project editor that "character" is used in several distinct contexts, and
that it would be inappropriate to simply improve one area without a
comprehensive review of all uses such that the existing consistency of uses of
character be replaced in a consistent new manner, as yet undetermined. As it
stands, although careful reading is strictly required, it is correct and as such
this is not a defect.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>What is the value of: <code>_Bool b = 0.0 + 3.0*I;</code></p>
<p>I believe that there is a contradiction between <strong>6.3.1.2 Boolean type</strong> and
<strong>6.3.1.7 Real and complex</strong> in that one requires that the value to be 1 and the
other requires the value to be 0.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6.3.1.2 Boolean type</strong></p>
<p>1 When any scalar value is converted to <strong>_Bool</strong>, the result is 0 if the value
compares equal to 0; otherwise, the result is 1.</p>
<p><strong>6.3.1.7 Real and complex</strong></p>
<p>2 When a value of complex type is converted to a real type, the imaginary part
of the complex value is discarded and the value of the real part is converted
according to the conversion rules for the corresponding real type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR 285 against C99 had a similar issue on conversion from imaginary to boolean.
That resulted in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>G.4.2 Real and imaginary</strong></p>
<p>1 When a value of imaginary type is converted to a real type other than
<strong>_Bool</strong>,376) the result is a positive zero.</p>
<p>376) See 6.3.1.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>I believe that <strong>6.3.1.7 Real and complex</strong>, paragraph 2 should be changed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 When a value of complex type is converted to a real type other than
<strong>_Bool</strong>(footnote), the imaginary part of the complex value is discarded and
the value of the real part is converted according to the conversion rules for
the corresponding real type.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>What is a <strong>directive name</strong>? What are the semantics of a <strong># non-directive</strong>?</p>
<p>In particular, what should happen for a translation unit with these four lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500"># non-directive</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500"># &quot;Long string&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500"># &#39;Many characters are implementation defined&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500"># 1234</span>
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>The syntax in <strong>6.10 Preprocessing directives</strong> has in group-part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># non-directive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The C standard section 6.10, paragraph 3 has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A non-directive shall not begin with any of the directive names appearing in the
syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find that confusing as <strong>directive name</strong> is only used in the C standard in
6.10 paragraphs 3 and 4 (without any definition). So, what is a <strong>directive
name</strong>?</p>
<p>Assuming <strong>directive name</strong> is one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>if</li>
<li>ifdef</li>
<li>ifndef</li>
<li>elif</li>
<li>else</li>
<li>endif</li>
<li>include</li>
<li>define</li>
<li>undef</li>
<li>line</li>
<li>error</li>
<li>pragma</li>
</ul>
<p>then my four line program contains lines that are</p>
<blockquote>
<p># non-directive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so should be valid. However, almost every C compiler I have tried considers them
errors that end translation. I did find at least one C compiler that ignored
them (treated them as comments). I did find at least one C compiler that
considered them errors even inside of:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#if 0</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">#endif</span>
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>where they should have been ignored.</p>
<p>I believe that gcc treats</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500"># 1234</span>
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>the same as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500"># line 1234</span>
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>I see no semantics for non-directive. So, what is supposed to happen with them?
Is it implicitly undefined?</p>
<p>Since preprocessing directives (which includes non-directive) are deleted at the
end of translation phase 4, these non-directives could act as comments.</p>
<p>DRs 231 and 250 appear to contradict each other on what happens with a
non-directive and neither refers to the other.</p>
<p><a href="log_c99.html#issue0231">DR 231</a> Says that text-line and non-directive are not
implementation defined. They are placeholders in the phases of translation and
are subject to normal processing in subsequent phases of translation. And that
words were supposed to be added to the Rationale.</p>
<p><a href="log_c99.html#issue0250">DR 250</a> Says that non-directive is a preprocessing directive. And,
it added that as a footnote in 6.10.3#11</p>
<p>Neither DR added normative words.</p>
<p>In answering this, we should consider what happens with mis-spellings, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>#endf</li>
<li>#deifine</li>
</ul>
<p>Should <strong># non-directive</strong> be a comment (and ignored)? Implementation defined?
An error that ends translation (like #error)? Undefined behaviour?</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Since I do not know what should happen, I have none. But, if we decide on
undefined behaviour, I would like that as explicit words.</p>

<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard intentionally does not define a value of <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code> for
implementations with no maximum.</p>
<p>The <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code> macro is used to limit recursion at thread
termination. The issue is that existing practice allows the creation of new
<code>tss</code> bindings during the destructor call, and one destructor might reincarnate
the original, thus forming an infinite recursive destructor loop. This loop may
appear non-deterministically and is difficult to detect. The purpose of
<code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code> is as a bound to such recursion.</p>
<p>It is possible monitor the recursion depth with careful defensive programming
and in those cases the value of <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code> is useful as that bound.</p>

<h2>Issue 0451: Instability of uninitialized automatic variables</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Freek Wiedijk and Robbert Krebbers (Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands)<br />
Date: 2013-08-30<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The standard is unclear about the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can an uninitialized variable with automatic storage duration (of a type that does not have trap values, whose address has been taken so 6.3.2.1p2 does not apply, and which is not volatile) change its value without direct action of the program?</li>
<li>If the answer to question 1 is "yes", then how far can this kind of "instability" propagate?</li>
<li>If "unstable" values can propagate through function arguments into a called function, can calling a C standard library function exhibit undefined behavior because of this?</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, consider:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">unsigned</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">char</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x[<span style="color: #666666">1</span>];<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">/* intentionally uninitialized */</span>
printf(<span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;%d</span><span style="color: #AA5D1F; font-weight: bold">\n</span><span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;</span>,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>]);
printf(<span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;%d</span><span style="color: #AA5D1F; font-weight: bold">\n</span><span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;</span>,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>]);
</pre></div>

<p>Does the standard allow an implementation to let this code print two different
values? And if so, if we insert either of the following three statements</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>x[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>];
x[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">+=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span>;
x[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">*=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span>;
</pre></div>

<p>between the declaration and the <code>printf</code> statements, is this behavior still
allowed? Or alternatively, can these <code>printf</code> statements exhibit undefined
behavior instead of having to print a reasonable number.</p>
<h4>Motivation and discussion</h4>
<p>The standard is unclear about these questions.</p>
<p>On the one hand the committee response to <a href="log_c99.html#issue0260">Defect Report #260</a>
strongly suggests that the committee decided that the standard implies the
answer to question 1 to be "yes". (Although Defect Report #260 applies to the
C99 standard and hence has been superseded by the C11 standard, no modification
to the standard text was deemed necessary at the time, and all relevant text in
the C11 standard is identical to that in the C99 standard.) The relevant quote
from the committee response to Defect Report #260 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of an indeterminate value [...] the actual bit-pattern may change
without direct action of the program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A subtlety is that Defect Report #260 talks about bit-patterns and not about
values, but for variables of type <code>unsigned char</code> there is a one-to-one
correspondence between bit-patterns and values.</p>
<p>Another argument in favor of "instability" of indeterminate values is that
values can "become indeterminate" (e.g. 5.1.2.3p5, 6.2.4p2, and 6.2.4p6). In
these cases the value of an object may also change without an explicit store
(and can keep changing?)</p>
<p>On the other hand, 6.7.9p10 states that the kind of uninitialized variables that
we are discussing get an indeterminate value. From 3.19.2 it follows that if a
type has no trap values, then indeterminate and unspecified values are the same.
And in 3.19.3, it is stated explicitly that an unspecified value is <em>chosen</em>.
Which implies that the value - after having been chosen - cannot change
anymore.</p>
<p>Another argument against "instability" is that 6.8p3 states that "the values are
stored in the objects (including <em>storing</em> an indeterminate value in objects
without an initializer) each time the declaration is reached in the order of
execution", and that 6.2.4p2 states that "An object [...] retains its
last-<em>stored</em> value throughout its lifetime." The only way that one could read
this in light of Defect Report #260 is if "retaining an indeterminate value" is
read as meaning that the indeterminateness of the value is retained, without the
value having a <em>specific</em> value.</p>
<p>It seems attractive to make a distinction between <em>indeterminate</em> values that
are allowed to change without direct action of the program in the way that
Defect Report #260 interpreted the standard, and <em>unspecified</em> values that do
not have this property. However the current text of 3.19.2 does not allow for
this interpretation. Also, probably some instances of "indeterminate" and
"unspecified" would need to be changed for such an interpretation to make sense.
(For example in 6.2.6.1p6 "the bytes of the object representation that
correspond to any padding bytes take unspecified values." should probably become
"... take indeterminate values.")</p>
<p>The reason for question 3 is that <em>if</em> the kind of "instability" that questions
1 and 2 ask for is allowed to propagate maximally, then it becomes impossible to
implement <code>printf</code> in C itself. When converting an indeterminate value to a
string of output characters, the value can <em>keep</em> changing underneath, and the
code cannot protect itself against this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if library functions exhibit undefined behavior on these
kinds of "unstable" uninitialized values, then an <code>fwrite</code> of a struct with
uninitialized padding bytes would also give undefined behavior. The fact that
one wants to be able to copy uninitialized padding bytes in structs using
<code>memcpy</code> without undefined behavior is the reason that using the value of an
uninitialized object is not undefined behavior. This seems to suggest that an
<code>fwrite</code> of a struct with uninitialized padding bytes should <em>not</em> exhibit
undefined behavior.</p>
<h3>Possible Resolutions</h3>
<p>We see three reasonable sets of answers to these questions:</p>
<h4>Resolution (a)</h4>
<ol>
<li>no</li>
<li>not applicable</li>
<li>not applicable</li>
</ol>
<h5>Advantage</h5>
<p>Easy to repair the unclarity in the standard. Just add text that explicitly
states that indeterminate values cannot change without direct action from the
program. This will prevent people from invoking the response to Defect Report
#260 from then on.</p>
<h5>Disadvantage</h5>
<p>Restricts the kind of optimizations compilers are allowed to perform.</p>
<h4>Resolution (b)</h4>
<ol>
<li>yes</li>
<li>any operation performed on indeterminate values will have an indeterminate value as its result</li>
<li>no</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, "unstable" values will also propagate through function calls.
Also, after</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>x[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>]<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">*=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span>;
</pre></div>

<p>the value of <code>x[0]</code> <em>still</em> will be "unstable" and hence still can be any byte,
and will not necessary be <code>0</code>.</p>
<h5>Advantage</h5>
<p>Gives compilers more freedom to perform optimizations.</p>
<p>Is Defect Report #260-compliant (i.e., "the committee did not change its mind").</p>
<h5>Disadvantage</h5>
<p>Needs more modifications to the text of the standard. It will then be necessary
to make an explicit distinction between "indeterminate non-trap value" and
"unspecified value".</p>
<h4>Resolution (c)</h4>
<ol>
<li>yes</li>
<li>any operation performed on indeterminate values will have an indeterminate value as its result</li>
<li>yes, library functions will exhibit undefined behavior when used on indeterminate values (probably functions like <code>memcpy</code> and maybe <code>fwrite</code> should be immune from this)</li>
</ol>
<h5>Advantage</h5>
<p>Restricts program behaviors least, giving compilers even more freedom.</p>
<h5>Disadvantage</h5>
<p>Needs even more modification to the text of the standard.</p>
<p>Needs a decision on what library functions will <em>not</em> have undefined behavior
when working on indeterminate values.</p>
<p>This is certainly not compatible with the current version of the standard, as no
undefined behavior of this kind related to library functions is described there.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<h5>For resolution (a)</h5>
<p>In 6.2.4p2, change "An object exists, has a constant address, and retains its
last-stored value throughout its lifetime." to "An object exists and has a
constant address throughout its lifetime. The value of an object is retained,
including the object representation, until some other value is stored into it,
or until the moment when the value becomes indeterminate (at which moment it is
replaced with an indeterminate value, and after which that value is retained
again)."</p>
<h5>For resolution (b)</h5>
<p>In 3.19.2 change "either an unspecified value or a trap representation" to
"either an unspecified value or a trap representation, which can change
arbitrarily without direct action from the program".</p>
<p>In 6.2.4p2, change "An object exists, has a constant address, and retains its
last-stored value throughout its lifetime." to "An object exists, has a constant
address, and retains its last-stored value (provided this value is not
indeterminate), throughout its lifetime."</p>
<p>At the end of 6.5p1 add "If at least one of the operands of an operator is
indeterminate, the result of the operator is also indeterminate."</p>
<p>Some instances of "indeterminate" and "unspecified" (to be determined) should be
replaced by respectively "unspecified" and "indeterminate". See for example the
instance in 6.2.6.1p6 mentioned earlier.</p>
<h5>For resolution (c)</h5>
<p>The changes for resolution (b), and also:</p>
<p>In 7.1.4p1 add: "If a function is called with an indeterminate value, the
behavior is undefined."</p>
<p>In a selection (to be determined) of functions from the library, add text that
counters this general statement added to 7.1.4p1.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The committee asserts that the answer to the first question is "yes", an uninitialized value under the conditions described can appear to change its value.</li>
<li>Since question 2 is applicable, the answer is that any operation performed on indeterminate values will have an indeterminate value as its result.</li>
<li>The answer to the applicable question 3 is that indeed library functions will exhibit undefined behavior when used on indeterminate values.</li>
<li>The committee notes that the problem applies to all types that do not have trap representations as per the implementation.</li>
<li>Strong sentiment formed, in part based on prior experience in developing Annex L, that a new category of "wobbly" value is needed. The underlying issue is that modern compilers track value propagation, and uninitialized values synthesized for an initial use of an object may be discarded as inconsequential prior to synthesizing a different value for a subsequent use. To require otherwise defeats important compiler optimizations. All uses of "wobbly" values might be deemed undefined behavior.</li>
<li>The principle of Resolution C is desired.</li>
<li>This requires careful thought.</li>

position changed to believing that "wobbly" values are not actually defined by
the standard, and after discussion agreed that the following committee response
would be an acceptable resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<ul>
<li>The answer to question 1 is "yes", an uninitialized value under the conditions described can appear to change its value.</li>
<li>The answer to question 2 is that any operation performed on indeterminate values will have an indeterminate value as a result.</li>
<li>The answer to question 3 is that library functions will exhibit undefined behavior when used on indeterminate values.</li>
<li>These answers are appropriate for all types that do not have trap representations.</li>
<li>This viewpoint reaffirms the C99 DR260 position.</li>
<li>The committee agrees that this area would benefit from a new definition of something akin to a "wobbly" value and that this should be considered in any subsequent revision of this standard.</li>
<li>The committee also notes that padding bytes within structures are possibly a distinct form of "wobbly" representation.</li>

<h2>Issue 0452: Effective Type in Loop Invariant</h2>
<p>Authors: WG 14, Shao Miller<br />
Date: 2013-09-29<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1762.htm">N1762</a><br />
Status: Fixed<br />
Fixed in: C17<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The definition for "effective type" does not appear to apply to non-lvalue
expressions. This can cause a behavioural difference, in loops.</p>
<p>6.5p6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effective type of an object for an access to its stored value is the
declared type of the object, if any.87) If a value is stored into an object
having no declared type through an lvalue having a type that is not a character
type, then the type of the lvalue becomes the effective type of the object for
that access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the stored value. If
a value is copied into an object having no declared type using memcpy or
memmove, or is copied as an array of character type, then the effective type of
the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that do not
modify the value is the effective type of the object from which the value is
copied, if it has one. For all other accesses to an object having no declared
type, the effective type of the object is simply the type of the lvalue used for
the access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>union u1 {<br />
int x;<br />
long y;<br />
};</p>
<p>int func1(void) {<br />
union u1 o1 = { 42 };</p>
<p>return (0, o1).x;<br />
}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>o1</code> sub-expression in the <code>return</code> statement's expression accesses the
stored union value of the object. The comma operator's result has that value,
but it is not an lvalue and so "effective type" does not appear to apply. While
the access to <code>o1</code> involves an access to a stored value, the membership operator
can be said to access an object whose value is available, but perhaps not
exactly "stored." <code>o1.x</code> is an lvalue, but <code>(0, o1).x</code> is not.</p>
<p>6.5.2.3p3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A postfix expression followed by the . operator and an identifier designates a
member of a structure or union object. The value is that of the named member,95)
and is an lvalue if the first expression is an lvalue. If the first expression
has qualified type, the result has the so-qualified version of the type of the
designated member.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.5p7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue expression that
has one of the following types:88)</p>
<ul>
<li>a type compatible with the effective type of the object,</li>
<li>a qualified version of a type compatible with the effective type of the object,</li>
<li>a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the effective type of the object,</li>
<li>a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a qualified version of the effective type of the object,</li>
<li>an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among its members (including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate or contained union), or</li>
<li>a character type.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>union u2 {<br />
int x;<br />
long y;<br />
char ca[2];<br />
};</p>
<p>int func2(void) {<br />
union u2 o2 = { 42 };</p>
<p>return (0, o2).x;<br />
}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a similar situation, even though <code>(0, o2)</code> yields an object with
temporary lifetime. (Side question: Should the expression <code>(0, o2).ca == o2.ca</code>
yield zero, non-zero, or should it be implementation-defined?)</p>
<p>Suppose we have a portable strategy to determine whether or not the object
representations of <code>int</code> and <code>long</code> are the same. If they are and if we have the
following code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>union u3 {<br />
int x;<br />
long y;<br />
};</p>
<p>long func3(void) {<br />
union u3 o3;</p>
<p>o3.x = 42;<br />
return (0, o3).y;<br />
}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are we violating the effective type rules? We might expect type-punning to be
relevant here and the membership operator to be accessing a member value of a
union value.</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, then does the Standard define the effective type of the
non-lvalue expression <code>0, o3</code> ?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, then this can cause the loss of an optimization opportunity
in the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>struct s4 {<br />
int x;<br />
float f;<br />
};</p>
<p>void func4(long * lp, struct s4 * s4p) {<br />
int c;</p>
<p>for (c = 0; c &lt; (0, *s4p).i; ++c)<br />
--*lp;<br />
}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not expect <code>*lp</code> to alias into <code>*s4p</code>, so we might optimize this loop such
that <code>(0, *s4p).i</code> is only computed once. If, in another translation unit, it
turned out that these did alias, the optimization would normally be justified
based on a violation of the effective type rules. If there isn't a violation
because of the non-lvalue nature of the comma operator's expression, then the
optimization would not appear to be justified.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>and question, what is the result of <code>(0,o2).ca == o2.ca</code>?</p>
<p>Given that the comma operator doesn't yield an lvalue (6.5.17), and from 6.2.4p8
such a non-lvalue expression is stated to have automatic storage duration, this
seems to require that the answer is false, even though this defeats compiler
optimizations.</p>
<p>The effective type rule 6.5.p6 also does not seem to apply to objects with
temporary lifetime, and has undesirable consequences.</p>
<p>The direction the committee would like to go is something like:</p>
<p>In 6.2.4p8, append</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An object with temporary lifetime behaves as if it had the declared type of its
value. Such an object is known as a <em>temporary object</em>. A temporary object need
not have a unique address.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The following words were drafted and approved by the committee as the Proposed
Technical Corrigendum.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To the question "Should the expression <code>(O, o2).ca == o2.ca</code> yield zero,
non-zero, or should it be implementation defined?" the answer is "implementation
defined".</p>
<p>With the following changes, the effective type of <code>O, o3</code> is defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In 6.2.4p8, append</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An object with temporary lifetime behaves as if it were declared with the type
of its value for the purposes of effective type. Such an object need not have a
unique address.</p>
<p>(add forward reference to 6.5p6 to this section)</p>

<h2>Issue 0453: Atomic flag type and operations</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It appears to me that there is a wording problem in 7.17.8.*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7.17.8 Atomic flag type and operations<br />
#1: The <strong>atomic_flag</strong> type provides the classic test-and-set functionality.
It has two states, set and clear.</p>
<p>7.17.8.1 The atomic_flag_test_and_set functions<br />
#2: Atomically sets the value pointed to by <strong>object</strong> to true.</p>
<p>#3: Atomically, the value of the object immediately before the effects.</p>
<p>7.17.8.2 The atomic_flag_clear functions<br />
#2: Atomically sets the value pointed to by <strong>object</strong> to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An issue is states (set, clear) versus values (true, false).</p>
<p>Does an atomic_flag structure have both states (set, clear) and values (true,
false)? Can it have all four combinations?</p>
<p>Another issue is 'set' is used both as a verb and a noun.</p>
<p>Another issue is: While the test is atomic, and the set is atomic, it is not
clear that both test and set are part of the same atomic operation.</p>
<p>I have been told that the same issues exists in the C++ standard (29.7
[atomics.flag]).</p>
<p>There was discussion of these topics on the WG14 reflector (around messages
13067 to 13073)</p>
<p>One person in the discussion would like the value zero (from default static
initialization) to be the clear state. They also mentioned DR 421.</p>
<p>Based upon the email discussion, the intent was that flags logically have
exactly two states: "set" and "clear". The test_and_set operation returns true
if it was "set", and false if it was "clear". Test_and_set sets the state to
"set", and the clear operations set the state to "clear". The value zero need
not be the "clear" state.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Replace</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7.17.8.1 The atomic_flag_test_and_set functions<br />
#2: Atomically sets the value pointed to by <strong>object</strong> to true.</p>
<p>#3: Atomically, the value of the object immediately before the effects.</p>
<p>7.17.8.2 The atomic_flag_clear functions<br />
#2: Atomically sets the value pointed to by <strong>object</strong> to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7.17.8.1 The atomic_flag_test_and_set functions<br />
#2: Tests the state of the flag pointed to by <strong>object</strong> and then sets the flag,
as a single atomic operation.</p>
<p>#3: Returns true if the flag was set when tested or false otherwise.</p>
<p>7.17.8.2 The atomic_flag_clear functions<br />
#2: Atomically clears the flag pointed to by <strong>object</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add to the rationale in the section on atomic flag:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The atomic flag type is defined in terms of states, not values, as the value
zero (false) need not be the "clear" state. The committee knows of one
implementation where zero is the "set" state.</p>

<p>What is the status of the additional state carried for guide1?</p>

<li>Something else</li>

<p>Is the state of guide1 the same as what guide6 has? If yes, does
"initialization-compatible" mean do the same thing as if atomic_init() of the
same object with the same value?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Issue 3 from N1777)</p>
<p><strong>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</strong> is not usable in assignment to an atomic object.</p>
<p>I see no difference between:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">atomic_int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>guide<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(<span style="color: #666666">42</span>);

<li>
<p>(Issue 4 from N1777)</p>
<p>What should happen if <strong>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</strong>(value) is used in context other than initializing an atomic object of the same type as the value?</p>
<p>Should it be undefined behaviour? A constraint violation? Just the value
<strong>value</strong> converted to the type of the object?</p>

<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</strong> macro prepares an atomic value that includes any extra
state necessary for a non-lock-free type. Initialization, by definition, ignores
all previous state. Assignment must honor the extra state that would indicate
another atomic operation in progress; such an assignment takes the non-atomic
corresponding value resulting from removing all qualifiers including atomic from
the value expression, and will manipulate the extra state held in the object to
assure proper atomic assignment semantics. <strong>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</strong> produces a
value appropriate for initialization because it will have any necessary extra
state, whereas a value suitable for assignment is the non-qualified version of
the assignment expression.</p>
<p>All uses of <strong>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</strong> other than for initialization result in
implicitly undefined behavior.</p>

<p>What is the status of the additional state carried for guide1?</p>

<li>Implicitly undefined</li>
<li>Indeterminate</li>
<li>Valid</li>
<li>Initialized</li>
<li>Something else</li>

<p>Is the state of guide1 the same as what guide6 has? If yes, does
"initialization-compatible" mean do the same thing as if atomic_init() of the
same object with the same value?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Issue 5 from N1777)</p>
<p>Zero initialization of static atomic objects in C requires more than in C++.</p>
<p>I have been told that C's 7.17.2.1#2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...; however, the default (zero) initialization for objects with static or
thread-local storage duration is guaranteed to produce a valid state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is not in C++. If true and assuming that the two languages should be the
"same" here, should this be deleted from C? Added to C++?</p>
<p>DR 422 is somewhat related to this issue.</p>

<h2>Issue 0456: Compile time definition of <code>UINT</code><em><code>N</code></em><code>_C(</code><em><code>value</code></em><code>)</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Rajan Bhakta<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>With reference to ISO/IEC WG14 N1569, subclause 7.20.4.1: The macro
<code>UINT</code><em><code>N</code></em><code>_C(</code><em><code>value</code></em><code>)</code> shall expand to an integer constant expression
corresponding to the type <code>uint_least</code><em><code>N</code></em><code>_t</code>.</p>
<p>7.20.4 p1 imposes a stricter requirement on the form of the expansion; it must
be an integer constant (for which paragraph 2 points to 6.4.4.1).</p>
<p>The type described in 7.20.4 p3 for the result of the expansion has an
interesting property; we observe this for <code>uint_least16_t</code> without reference to
the <code>UINT16_C</code> macro by using <code>u'\0'</code> in a context where it will be first
promoted as part of the usual arithmetic conversions:</p>

<p>The code presented should neither fail to compile nor abort when executed (for
example) on a system using two's complement and 8, 16 and 32 bits (respectively)
for <code>char</code>, <code>short</code> and <code>int</code> with no padding bits.</p>
<p>Consider the case for N = 8 or 16 on systems with <code>INT_MAX</code> as +2147483647,
<code>UCHAR_MAX</code> as 255 and <code>USHRT_MAX</code> as 65535: it is unclear how a macro can be
formed such that it expands to an integer constant that has the promoted signed
int type in phase 7 of translation and also the promoted <code>unsigned int</code> type in
phase 4 of translation without special (non-standard) support from the compiler.</p>
<p>Even if the requirement for an integer constant is relaxed to only require an
integer constant expression, the case for N = 8 on systems with <code>INT_MAX</code> as
+32767 and <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> as 255 remains a problem without the use of casts (since
<code>uint_least16_t</code>, for which we can form a literal, has different promotion
behaviour from <code>uint_least8_t</code>).</p>
<p>Implementations seen:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>#define UINT8_C(c) c ## U</code></li>
<li><code>#define UINT8_C(c) c</code></li>
</ol>
<p>DR 209 seemed to try to address the issue of needing special compiler support in
order to define the macros for integer constants; however, the problem seems to
remain.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add in suffixes for char and short literals.</li>
<li>Remove the <code>UINT{8,16}_C</code> macros from the standard.</li>

<h2>Issue 0457: The <code>ctime_s</code> function in Annex K defined incorrectly</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, David Keaton (suggested by Jens Gustedt)<br />
Date: 2014-03-13<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1802.htm">N1802</a><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <code>ctime_s</code> function in Annex K was defined analogously to <code>ctime</code>, and some
of the text from the definition of <code>ctime</code> was copied and modified slightly.</p>
<p>K.3.8.2.2p4 states that <code>ctime_s</code> is equivalent to the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>asctime_s(s,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>maxsize,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>localtime_s(timer))
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the text from the original <code>ctime</code> definition was not quite
modified enough.  The <code>localtime_s</code> function takes two arguments and the above
code only supplies one.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In K.3.8.2.2p4, replace</p>
<blockquote>

<h2>Issue 0458: ATOMIC_XXX_LOCK_FREE macros not constant expressions</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Section <strong>7.17.1 Introduction</strong> (to section <strong>7.17 Atomics</strong> <code>&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</code>)
specifies that the <code>&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</code> header define a number of macros having the
form <code>ATOMIC_XXX_LOCK_FREE</code> that indicate the lock-free property of the
corresponding atomic types. No further description of the macros is provided
here.</p>
<p>Section <strong>7.17.5 Lock-free property</strong>, then goes on to specify that the atomic
lock-free macros (presumably the same ones as those listed in 7.17.1) expand to
one of three values: 0, 1, or 2.</p>
<p>Neither of the two sections above, nor any other in the standard, specifies
whether or not the macros are required to expand to constant expressions usable
in preprocessor <code>#if</code> directives. This is in contrast to some other standard
macros such as those defined in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> which are typically so specified
using language such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The values given below shall be replaced by constant expressions suitable for
use in <code>#if</code> preprocessing directives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As discussed in the thread starting with SC22WG14.13216, the only purpose for
the existence of the <code>ATOMIC_XXX_LOCK_FREE</code> macros is to be able to write more
efficient code by relying on their use in preprocessor <code>#if</code> conditionals. Thus,
the absence of the requirement that they expand to constant expressions makes
the macros unsuitable for that purpose.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In section 7.17.1, modify paragraph 3 as indicated below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...which <ins>expand to constant expressions suitable for use in <code>#if</code>
preprocessing directives and which</ins> indicate the lock-free property of the
corresponding atomic types (both signed and unsigned); and</p>

<p>The absence of the <code>const</code> qualifier implies that the functions cannot be called
with an argument of type <code>const</code> <em><code>A</code></em><code>*</code> since there is no such conversion.</p>
<p>However, since neither function modifies its argument, there is no need to
prevent it from being called with an argument of type <code>const</code> <em><code>A</code></em><code>*</code>. And, in
fact, the latest draft C++ standard as of this writing,
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/prot/14882fdis/n3936.pdf" title="Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++">N3936</a>, does provide an
overload of each function that takes a <code>const volatile</code> pointer.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>

<h2>Issue 0460: <code>aligned_alloc</code> underspecified</h2>

Date: 2014-03-22<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <code>aligned_alloc</code> function specifies the following constraints on its
arguments, <code>alignment</code> and <code>size</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of <code>alignment</code> shall be a valid alignment supported by the
implementation and the value of <code>size</code> shall be an integral multiple of
alignment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the behavior of the function is undefined when either constraint is
violated.</p>
<p>According to section 6.2.8, paragraph 1, the greatest alignment a conforming
implementation is required to support (known as <em>fundamental alignment</em>) is
<code>_Alignof(max_align_t)</code>. Furthermore, according to paragraph 2 of the same
section, whether alignments greater than the fundamental alignment (known as
<em>extended alignments</em>) are supported and in what contexts is
implementation-defined.</p>
<p>The standard specifies no mechanism by which programs could determine whether an
extended alignment is supported by an implementation, or whether the
<code>aligned_alloc</code> function is among the contexts where an extended alignment is
supported.</p>
<p>As a result, there is no way for strictly conforming programs to use the
<code>aligned_alloc</code> function with an <code>alignment</code> argument greater than the result of
<code>_Alignof(max_align_t)</code>. Since the <code>malloc</code> function returns objects that meet
the same alignment requirement, this restriction makes <code>aligned_alloc</code> useless
in portable programs.</p>
<p>This restriction is unnecessary since it's possible, and in fact nearly trivial
given access to the internal details of the memory allocator, to implement an
efficient <code>aligned_function</code> that fails when its arguments don't meet the
specified requirements.</p>
<p>As a data point, the POSIX Advanced Realtime function
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/posix_memalign.html"><code>posix_memalign</code></a>,
as well as the historical BSD <code>memalign</code> function, are both required to return a
null pointer when either of their arguments don't meet the specified
requirements (in addition to setting <code>errno</code> to <code>EINVAL</code>.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The proposed corrigendum below changes the standard to require <code>aligned_alloc</code>
to fail by returning a null pointer when either of its constraints is violated.</p>
<p>In section 7.22.3.1, modify paragraph 2 as indicated below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>aligned_alloc</code> function allocates space for an object whose alignment is
specified by <code>alignment</code>, whose size is specified by <code>size</code>, and whose value is
indeterminate. <del>T</del><ins>If t</ins>he value of <code>alignment</code> <del>shall
be</del> <ins>is not</ins> a valid alignment supported by the implementation
<del>and</del><ins>or</ins> the value of <code>size</code> <del>shall be</del><ins>is
not</ins> an integral multiple of <code>alignment</code> <ins>the function shall fail by
returning a null pointer</ins>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, in section <strong>J.2 Undefined behavior</strong>, remove the following bullet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>— The alignment requested of the aligned_alloc function is not valid or
not supported by the implementation, or the size requested is not an integral
multiple of the alignment (7.22.3.1).</del></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the proposal above isn't acceptable, then an alternative solution to consider
that would allow <code>aligned_alloc</code> to be used even in strictly conforming programs
is to add a new function to determine whether a given alignment is supported by
an implementation. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">_Bool</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF">alignment_is_valid</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #B00040">size_t</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>alignment);
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Returns</strong></p>
<p>The <code>alignment_is_valid</code> function returns non-zero if the value specified by
<code>alignment</code> is a valid alignment argument to the <code>aligned_alloc</code> function, and
zero otherwise.</p>

<h2>Issue 0461: problems with references to objects in signal handlers</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We believe there are two problems in section <strong>7.14.1.1 The signal function</strong>,
paragraph 5, which specifies the constraints under which signal handlers can
access objects declared in other scopes. The problems are summarized in the
following two subsections. The section titled Suggested Technical Corrigendum
then proposes a correction to both.</p>
<p>Section <strong>7.14.1.1 The signal function</strong>, paragraph 5, specifies the following
constraints. Note, in particular, to use of the word "refers," and the reference
to objects with "static or thread storage duration" underscored in the text
below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the <code>abort</code> or <code>raise</code>
function, the behavior is undefined if the signal handler <ins>refers</ins> to
any object with <ins>static or thread storage duration</ins> that is not a
lock-free atomic object other than by assigning a value to an object declared as
<code>volatile sig_atomic_t</code>, or the signal handler calls any function in the
standard library other than the abort function, the <code>_Exit</code> function, the
<code>quick_exit</code> function, or the <code>signal</code> function with the first argument equal to
the signal number corresponding to the signal that caused the invocation of the
handler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Underspecification of referring to objects</strong></p>
<p>The standard doesn't formally define the term <em>refer</em> but its uses in the text
suggest that it denotes any use of an object, including one that doesn't involve
accessing it. The term <em>access</em> is defined in 3.1 to mean an &lt;execution-time
action&gt; <em>to read or modify the value of an object.</em></p>
<p>Preventing signal handlers from accessing objects is necessary in order to avoid
data races between accesses (reads and writes) to the same object in the rest of
the program that are in progress but not completed at the time the signal is
delivered.</p>
<p>However, by making use of the word "refers," the sentence in 7.14.1.1 quoted
above implies that even mentioning the name of an object in an unevaluated
context such as the <code>sizeof</code> expression, or taking its address is undefined in a
signal handler. This restriction is unnecessary, since such references are safe
because they cannot introduce any sort of a data race between the signal handler
and the rest of the program. Thus, referring to such objects without accessing
them should be permitted in conforming programs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, accessing a <code>const</code> object to read (but not modify) its value also
cannot introduce a data race and is safe as well. Thus, the restriction can be
relaxed even further to allow signal handlers to read constant objects. Note
that <code>const</code> objects are those that are declared <code>const</code>. In particular,
accessing an object that was not declared const via a pointer to a
<code>const</code>-qualified type does not change the fact that the object itself is not
<code>const</code>. This distinction is important to understand that relaxing this
constraint cannot introduce the potential for a data race when such a
non-<code>const</code> object is modied in the program while it's accessed via a
<code>const</code>-qualified pointer in a signal handler.</p>
<p>The comments in the following example should make this distinction clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>const int safe = (1 &lt;&lt; SIGINT) | (1 &lt;&lt; SIGQUIT);</code><br />
<code>int unsafe = (1 &lt;&lt; SIGHUP) | (1 &lt;&lt; SIGTERM);</code></p>
<p><code>volatile sig_atomic_t sigcount [2];</code></p>
<p><code>void handler (int signo) {</code></p>
<p><code>const int *pmask;   // pointer to</code> <ins><code>const</code></ins> <code>int</code></p>
<p><code>// taking the address of any object is safe and should be allowed</code><br />
<code>pmask = &amp;safe;</code></p>
<p><code>// access to safe should be allowed since it's a</code> <ins><code>const object</code></ins><br />
<code>if ((1 &lt;&lt; signo) &amp; *pmask)</code><br />
<code>++sigcount [0];</code></p>
<p><code>// safe and should be allowed</code><br />
<code>pmask = &amp;unsafe;</code></p>
<p><code>// access to unsafe remains undefined since it's</code> <ins><code>not a const object</code></ins><br />
<code>if ((1 &lt;&lt; signo) &amp; *pmask)</code><br />
<code>++sigcount [1];</code><br />
<code>}</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Missing restriction to access other functions' local objects</strong></p>
<p>The sentence from paragraph 5 quoted above specifically singles out objects with
static or thread storage duration, but permits signal handlers to access objects
with automatic storage duration without a similar restriction. However, a signal
handler that has access to a local variable defined in another function whose
execution is interrupted by the delivery of a signal resulting in the invocation
of the signal handler contains the same potential data race as if the two
functions both accessed the same object with static storage duration.</p>
<p>To make clear how this condition could arise, consider the following program
which, when <code>atomic_intptr_t</code> is a lock-free type, is strictly conforming
according to the letter of the standard despite the data race.</p>

<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The proposed corrigendum below changes the standard to remove the unnecessary
constraints discussed above, and to add the missing restriction to prevent
accessing local variables defined elsewhere in the program. The reference to the
lifetime of auto objects makes sure that accesses to local variables defined in
signal handlers themselves as well as in functions called from them remain well
defined.</p>
<p>In section 7.14.1.1, modify the first sentence of paragraph 5 as indicated
below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the <code>abort</code> or <code>raise</code>
function, the behavior is undefined if the signal handler <del>refers
to</del><ins>accesses</ins> any <ins>non-<code>const</code></ins> object with static or
thread storage duration<ins>, or any non-<code>const</code> object with automatic storage
duration whose lifetime started before the signal handler has been
entered,</ins> that is not a lock-free atomic object other than by...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, make the corresponding change to section <strong>J.2 Undefined
behavior</strong>.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The committee agrees that clarifying "refers" would be beneficial.</li>
<li>Allowing access to <code>const</code> qualified objects would be a feature and cannot be accomplished by the mechanism of a defect report. Such a feature can be proposed in a separate paper.</li>
<li>Access to objects of allocated storage duration should also be addressed.</li>
<li>It is suggested that automatic storage duration objects should also be addressed.</li>
<li>Further revisions have been solicited from the author.</li>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The paper <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1874.htm">N1874</a>
was submitted and discussed, again, as a defect, rather than as a new proposal,
and the suggested changes to allow new behavior were again rejected. It was
noted that a <code>const volatile</code> object implemented in hardware, such as random
number generator, might not provide a consistent value if accessed from a signal
handler, and so there was general agreement that any changes in this area
warrant very careful consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Extending the behavior as requested is a feature and appropriate as input to the
next revision of this Standard. It was noted that a <code>const volatile</code> object that
might seem acceptable to reference from a signal handler might not be if it were
implemented in hardware (e.g. a hardware random number generator).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It appears the intent of the committee in Subclause 5.1.2.3 paragraph 5 was to
allow lock-free atomic objects or objects of type <code>volatile sig_atomic_t</code> to be
accessed from a signal handler.  Objects of type <code>atomic_flag</code> are an obvious
choice operations on an object of type <code>atomic_flag</code> are required to be lock
free. However, objects of type <code>atomic_flag</code> can only be meaningfully accessed
by a call to a function, and calls to these functions from a signal handler are
undefined behavior according to subclause 7.14.1.1 paragraph 5.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Change subclause 7.14.1.1 paragraph 5 from:</p>
<p>If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the <code>abort</code> or <code>raise</code>
function, the behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers to any object
with static or thread storage duration that is not a lock-free atomic object
other than by assigning a value to an object declared as <code>volatile sig_atomic_t</code>, or the signal handler calls any function in the standard library
other than the <code>abort</code> function, the <code>_Exit</code> function, the <code>quick_exit</code>
function, or the <code>signal</code> function with the first argument equal to the signal
number corresponding to the signal that caused the invocation of the handler.
Furthermore, if such a call to the <code>signal</code> function results in a <code>SIG_ERR</code>
return, the value of <code>errno</code> is indeterminate.<sup>252)</sup></p>

<h2>Issue 0463: Left-shifting into the sign bit</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Aaron Ballman<br />
Date: 2014-04-02<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1817.pdf">N1817</a><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Harmonizing left-shift with C++14</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to see code such as:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">signed</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>someint_t<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>min_value<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">1</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&lt;&lt;</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(CHAR_BIT<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">*</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">sizeof</span>(someint_t));
</pre></div>

<p>However, left-shifting a one bit into the sign bit is undefined behavior,
despite the fact that the majority of (twos-complement) architectures handle it
properly.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>6.5.7p4 should be modified to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of <code>E1 &lt;&lt; E2</code> is <code>E1</code> left-shifted <code>E2</code> bit positions; vacated bits
are filled with zeros. If <code>E1</code> has an unsigned type, the value of the result is
<code>E1 x 2</code><sup><code>E2</code></sup>, reduced modulo one more than the maximum value
representable in the result type. If <code>E1</code> has a signed type and nonnegative
value, and <code>E1 x 2</code><sup><code>E2</code></sup> is representable in the <ins>corresponding
unsigned type of the</ins> result type, then that <ins>value, converted to the
result type,</ins> is the resulting value; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C++ addressed this in C++14 with DR1457 with identical wording
modifications.</p>

<h2>Issue 0464: Clarifying the Behavior of the <code>#line</code> Directive</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, David Keaton (suggested by Max Woodbury)<br />
Date: 2014-06-27<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1842.htm">N1842</a><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Context:</p>
<p>In a distributed development environment, the exact file name passed to the
compiler or preprocessor may vary from site to site. It is therefore desirable
to be able to set the file name as seen by <code>__FILE__</code> and elsewhere to a uniform
value. The mechanism to do this is the '<code>#line &lt;num&gt; "&lt;string&gt;"</code>' form of the
'<code>#line</code>' preprocessor directive. It is also necessary that such a directive
leave the line numbering sequence unchanged. Further, it is desirable that edits
that change the location of the directive in the source module should not
require modification to the directive and that comments embedded in the
directive likewise do not have to be accounted for.</p>
<p>Searches of the online literature show that a directive of the form '<code>#line __LINE__ "string"</code>' is expected to have this property.</p>
<p>Despite this, at least one compiler/preprocessor does not allow this.</p>
<p>Technical argument:</p>
<p>The value substituted for the predefined macro '<code>__LINE__</code>' is specified in
6.10.8.1p1 as the presumed line number of the current source line. The presumed
line number is initially (6.10.4p2) the number of newline characters (or their
equivalent) seen in phase 1 of the translation process, plus 1, <em>at the time of
substitution</em>. (Note that this is <em>not</em> the same as the time of tokenization,
which is where the failing compilers make their mistake.) The mechanism for
transferring this count between phase 1 and phase 4, where macro substitution
takes place, is not specified, but may be presumed to exist and be reliable. (If
it were not, the <code>__LINE__</code> predefined macro would be useless.) That makes the
question 'when does the substitution take place?'</p>
<p>Macro substitution in directives is a separate issue from macro expansion in
code. It does <em>not</em> always take place. If and when it occurs depends on the
directive and the details of its form. That means the entire directive has to be
'in hand' in order to be evaluated, and that means, in turn, that the newline
that terminates the directive has to have been seen. The standard goes to some
length to specify the various directive forms and all include the terminating
newline in their specification.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a substitution is made for '<code>__LINE__</code>', its value should be the
line count following the end of the directive, which is the same as the line
number of next line in the source module. This is precisely the value that
produces the desired property of the '<code>#line __LINE__ "string"</code>' directive.</p>
<p>Correction requested:</p>
<p>While there is no need to change the standard's normative text, a note that
'<code>#line __LINE__ "string"</code>' and similar directives leaves line numbering
unchanged would both be educational and make misinterpretations more difficult.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Append the following to footnote 177 in 6.10.8.1p1:</p>
<p><code>#line __LINE__ "newfilename"</code> changes the presumed file name without changing
the presumed line number.</p>
<hr />
<p>Comment from WG14 on 2017-11-03:</p>
<p>Oct 2014 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee discussed the Proposed Technical Corrigendum from
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1842.htm">N1842</a> and found
that it didn't sufficiently clarify the issue. Investigation during the meeting
revealed that several (in fact all that were tested) compilers did not seem to
follow the interpretation of the standard as given in N1842, and that it would
be best to acknowledge this as unspecified behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>6.10.4 paragraph 2 states that “The <em>line number</em> of the current source line is
one greater than the number of new-line characters read or introduced in
translation phase 1 (5.1.1.2) while processing the source file to the current
token.” Note that it does not say the number of new-line characters that exist
prior to the current token; it says the number of new-line characters that have
been read while processing to the current token.</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>#line</code> directive of the form</p>
<p><code>#line</code> <em>pp-tokens new-line</em></p>
<p>there are two possible values for the number of new-line characters that have
been read when processing begins on the first <em>pp-token</em>. In a one-pass
preprocessor, the line number at the first <em>pp-token</em> will be the number of
new-line characters that exist prior to the <code>#line</code> directive, because that
number of new-lines will have been read. In a preprocessor that must see the
entire directive before processing it, since the directive explicitly includes a
new-line, the line number at the first <em>pp-token</em> will be the number of new-line
characters that exist prior to the <code>#line</code> directive plus one.</p>
<p>Therefore, in a <code>#line</code> directive of the form</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#line __LINE__ “filename”</span>
</pre></div>

<p>there are two possible values for <code>__LINE__</code>, which leads to two possible values
for the line number following the <code>#line</code> directive. Both are valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add the following footnote to the end of 6.10.4 paragraph 5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because a new-line is explicitly included as part of the <code>#line</code> directive, the
number of new-line characters read while processing to the first <em>pp-token</em> may
be different depending on whether or not the implementation uses a one-pass
preprocessor. Therefore, there are two possible values for the line number
following a directive of the form <code>#line __LINE__ new-line</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add the following to J.1 Unspecified behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The line number following a directive of the form <code>#line __LINE__ new-line</code>
(6.10.4).</p>

<h2>Issue 0465: Fixing an inconsistency in <code>atomic_is_lock_free</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, David Keaton (suggested by Hans Boehm)<br />
Date: 2014-07-14<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The C committee intended to adopt the same model for atomics as C++ to ensure
compatibility. Somewhere along the way, there was an error in synchronizing with
the C++ atomic model. This could have serious consequences for code that needs
to share atomic objects between modules written in C and modules written in
C++ (for example, in the case of libraries written in one language being used
by a program written in the other).</p>
<p>The C++ standard states the following in 29.4p2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function <code>atomic_is_lock_free</code> (29.6) indicates whether the object is
lock-free. <em>In any given program execution, the result of the lock-free query
shall be consistent for all pointers of the same type.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the C standard states the following in 7.17.5.1p3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>atomic_is_lock_free</code> generic function returns nonzero (true) if and only if
the object's operations are lock-free. <em>The result of a lock-free query on one
object cannot be inferred from the result of a lock-free query on another
object.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary issue is compatibility. Secondarily, if the lock-free property for a
given pointer type can change after an algorithm starts, then
<code>atomic_is_lock_free</code> cannot be used to select an algorithm in advance if the
algorithm will allocate new atomic objects. The C++ model is therefore more
useful.</p>
<p>The error in synchronizing with C++ should be fixed by correcting the behavior
of <code>atomic_is_lock_free</code> to be the same in C as in C++.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Replace the following sentence from 7.17.5.1p3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of a lock-free query on one object cannot be inferred from the result
of a lock-free query on another object.</p>

<h2>Issue 0466: scope of a <code>for</code> loop control declaration</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Martin Sebor<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The scope of a <code>for</code> loop control declaration in C is different from that in
C++. In particluar, while in C the declaration establishes its own scope in
which the scope of the body of the <code>for</code> statement is nested, in C++ the two
are one and the same. The practical implication of this difference is that while
in C a declaration in the body can hide the <code>for</code> loop declaration, in C++
such a re-declaration would be ill-formed. The following example demonstrates
the difference:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">        </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">static</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">inline</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF">f</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #B00040">void</span>)<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{

</pre></div>

<p>During a discussion of this difference on the mailing list (starting with post
C22WG14.13355), it was noted that the re-declaration could lead to subtle bugs.</p>
<p>The incompatibility between rules used by the two languages also makes writing
headers intended to be used by both C and C++ that contain inline functions
more prone to error than necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, it was noted (by Larry Jones in SC22WG14.13359) that the intent was
for C99, where the ability to declare a <code>for</code> loop control variable was first
added, to follow the C++ rules, but that it had been missed that the C++
rules ultimately adopted by ISO/IEC 14882:1998 changed from those of The
Annotated C++ Reference Manual that was initially used to craft the C rules.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The author recognizes that changing the C rules could render some existing
programs invalid. However, it is likely that such programs are broken/buggy and
thus a breaking change would result in correcting such latent bugs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the proposed corrigendum suggests to align the C rules with those of
C++ by adding a new paragraph to section <strong>6.2.1 Scopes of identifiers</strong> as
follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><ins>Names declared in <em>clause-1</em> of the <code>for</code> statement are local to the <code>for</code>
statement and shall not be redeclared in a subsequent condition of that
statement nor in the outermost block of the controlled statement.</ins></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: the text of the paragraph is aligned with the corresponding paragraph 4 of
section <strong>3.3.3 Block scope</strong> of ISO/IEC 14882:2014 (and section <strong>3.3.2 Block
scope</strong> of ISO/IEC 14882:1998).</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<p>The committee accepted this as a DR because there was an intent to not be
gratuitously different than C++, and yet this small drift occurred.</p>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This small and unintended difference between the two languages is known and some
of its uses were discussed. It also turns out that some C++ compilers also
know and allow this construct with a warning. Overall, the committee concludes
that this is not an area we wish to change.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>formula for maximum representable finite (normalized) floating-point numbers in
5.2.4.2.2#12, and epsilon floating-point numbers in 5.2.4.2.2#13.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The math formula is for a normalized number, while the words are missing
'normalized'. Now, in the floating-point model in paragraph 2, the maximum
finite number is the same as the maximum finite normalized number, so it did not
matter.</p>
<p>However, if long double is a pair of doubles (not matching the model in
paragraph 2), then there can be finite numbers larger than the largest
normalized finite number. The largest normalized finite number is
DBL_MAX*(1.+DBL_EPSILON/2.), while the largest finite number can be
DBL_MAX*2.</p>
<p>Also, if long double is a pair of doubles (not matching the model in paragraph
2), then 'least value greater than 1 that is representable in the given floating
point type' is (for double) 1.0+DBL_TRUE_MIN. That makes the difference
DBL_TRUE_MIN, which is not the same at the math formula (b to the power
(1-p)).</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#13, add 'normalized' between 'least' and 'value'.</p>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#12, add 'normalized' between 'finite' and 'floating-point'.</p>
<p>Add a new paragraph:</p>
<p>12b The values given in the following list shall be replaced by constant
expressions with implementation-defined values that are greater than or equal to
those shown:</p>
<p>-- maximum representable finite floating-point number (footnote),</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FLT_TRUE_MAX 1E+37</strong></li>
<li><strong>DBL_TRUE_MAX 1E+37</strong></li>

<h2>Issue 0468: <code>strncpy_s</code> clobbers buffer past <code>null</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Martin Sebor<br />
Date: 2014-09-19<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>K.3.7.1.4, p5 permits <code>strncpy_s</code> to "clobber" characters in the destination
buffer past the terminating <code>null</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All elements following the terminating null character (if any) written by
<code>strncpy_s</code> in the array of <code>s1max</code> characters pointed to by <code>s1</code> take
unspecified values when <code>strncpy_s</code> returns. <sup>420)</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnote 420 explains that the intent is to allow implementations to copy
characters from <code>s2</code> to <code>s1</code> while simultaneously checking if any of those
characters are null. Such an approach might write a character to every element
of <code>s1</code> before discovering that the first element should be set to the null
character.</p>
<p>This intent is to allow efficient implementations to make a single pass over the
source sequence that simultaneously copies characters and checks the runtime
constraints. (Otherwise two passes would be required, one to compute the length
of the source sequence and another to copy it.)</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that the implementation latitude granted by this text
goes too far, since the function only might need to write past the null after a
constraint violation. Otherwise, when all runtime constraints are satisfied, the
function stops copying characters after either the first null is encountered or
all <code>n</code> characters have been copied.</p>
<p>Since the mention of unspecified values tends to raise security concerns about
information leakage, and since permitting the implementations to modify the
contents of the destination buffer past the terminating null on success serves
no useful purpose, the requirements on the function can and should be tightened
up.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The proposed corrigendum below tightens up the requirements on the function so
as to leave intact the contents of the destination buffer past the terminating
null on success, while allowing it to clobber its contents on runtime constraint
violation.</p>
<p>Modify K.3.7.1.4, p5 as indicated below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All elements following the terminating null character (if any) written by
<code>strncpy_s</code> in the array of <code>s1max</code> characters pointed to by <code>s1</code> take

<h2>Issue 0469: lock ownership vs. thread termination</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If a mutex M is acquired by a thread T, and afterwards T terminates without
releasing ownership of M, then the resulting state after termination of T seems
to be unspecified.</p>
<p>Specifically, N1570 7.26.4.5p2 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mtx_trylock function endeavors to lock the mutex pointed to by mtx. If the
mutex is already locked, the function returns without blocking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is no statement about whether a mutex whose owner has terminated
remains locked. This seems to be a source of confusion, and it affects
implementations. C++11 specifies that such a case results in undefined
behavior (see 30.4.1.2.1p5). On the other hand, POSIX wants (PThreads) mutexes
to remain locked in this case (see Austin Group Bug
<a href="http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=755">755</a>).</p>
<p>From an implementation perspective, the C++11 semantics are more practical
because they do not require implementations to maintain identities of threads
that do not exist any more. For example, with C++11 semantics, an
implementation can just use a thread ID to identify an owner, even if another
thread eventually reuses the same ID (e.g., a process ID) after the former
owning thread terminated. In contrast, the POSIX semantics require an
implementation to avoid ABA issues on the thread identities (i.e., the same
value representing different states of ownership). This effectively results in a
higher runtime overhead for lock acquisition or for lock initialization of at
least recursive mutexes, or address space leakage (or other workarounds).</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>I would like the expected behavior to be explicitly specified. To me, C should
do what C++11 states. In particular, add the following or a similar sentence
at an appropriate place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The behavior of a program is undefined if a thread terminates while owning a
mutex.</p>

<h2>Issue 0470: mtx_trylock should be allowed to fail spuriously</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>C11 does not <em>appear</em> to allow <code>mtx_trylock</code> to fail spuriously (i.e., return
<code>thrd_busy</code> even thought the lock was not acquired, yet eventually acquire the
lock if it is not acquired by any thread), but C++11 does (see 30.4.1.1/16):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An implementation may fail to obtain the lock even if it is not held by any
other thread. [ Note: This spurious failure is normally uncommon, but allows
interesting implementations based on a simple compare and exchange (Clause 29).
-- end note ] An implementation should ensure that try_lock() does not
consistently return false in the absence of contending mutex acquisitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might be better to point out explicitly that programmers should treat
<code>mtx_trylock</code> as if spurious failure were allowed, since the memory model is
intentionally too weak to support correct reasoning that is based on a return
value of <code>thrd_busy</code>. There has been debate on this issue, and we would prefer
the standard to be clearer. Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>Thread<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">1:</span>

<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span>out(r2);
</pre></div>

<p>This program is not data-race-free according to C11, independently of whether
<code>mtx_trylock</code> is allowed to fail spuriously or not; the happens-before-based
definition of a data race and the current specification of synchronizes-with
relations between mutex operations makes it clear that the program above has a
data race on <code>v1</code>.</p>
<p>However, if spurious failures are not allowed, an intuitive understanding of the
memory model in the sense that everything will appear to be sequentially
consistent if only locks are used to synchronize does not hold anymore. The
intuitive understanding would make the program above correct; in particular the
store to <code>v1</code> by the first thread would be expected to "happen before" the load
from <code>v1</code> by the second thread.</p>
<p>Therefore, to make an intuitive understanding of the C11 memory model and locks
match the actual specification, it would be helpful to point out that
programmers should assume <code>mtx_trylock</code> to fail spuriously. Otherwise, without
spurious failure, we have cases like the example above in which two operations
race according to the specification in spite of the fact that they intuitively
can't execute at the same time.</p>
<p>Allowing spurious failures does not affect the typical uses of <code>mtx_trylock</code>,
for example to acquire several locks without risk of deadlock. It does rule out
uses like the example above, however, in which locks are attempted to be used as
a replacement for atomics.</p>
<p>(Note that we are not arguing for specifying that <code>mtx_lock</code> should synchronize
with a <code>mtx_trylock</code> that returns <code>thrd_busy</code>. This would make the
implementation of lock acquisition less efficient on architectures such as ARM
or PowerPC. In particular, an <code>atomic_compare_exchange</code> or similar that
transitions the lock's state from not acquired to acquired would have to use
<code>memory_order_acq_rel</code> instead of <code>memory_order_acquire</code>.)</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>It seems that the normative specification already states the preferred
semantics, although the return value specification for <code>thrd_busy</code> may make
readers believe that this return code allows one to infer a certain ordering
(see the example above).</p>
<p>We propose to add a clarifying note at an appropriate place (e.g., in
7.26.4.5p3):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programmers should treat <code>mtx_trylock</code> as if spurious failures were allowed; the
memory model is intentionally too weak to support reasoning based on a return
value of <code>thrd_busy</code>.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A spurious failure can occur on PPC/ARM style architectures if, after the
load-word-and-reserve instruction is issued the operating system schedules the
task out, and upon resumption the corresponding store-word fails because the
reservation is lost, even if the lock is unlocked. This failure can be seen by
<code>mtx_trylock</code> if it is implemented with <code>atomic_compare_exchange_weak</code> where
this failure can occur.</p>
<p>A new paper was solicited to extract the corresponding words from C++ so as to
keep the two standards as close as possible in this area.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Complex math functions (cacosh (G.6.2.1) and ctanh(G.6.2.6)) are incorrectly
specified.</p>
<ol>
<li>cacosh( 0.0 + I*NaN ) should be NaN + I*pi/2 (not NaN + I*NaN).</li>
</ol>
<p>Reasons: Mathematically, cacosh(0.0+I*y) = asinh(y) + I*pi/2. Also, C
requires cacos(0+I*NaN) to be pi/2+I*NAN, which along with the
mathematically identity cacosh(z) = +/-I * cacos(z), means cacosh(0.0 +
I*NaN) is NaN + I*pi/2.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>ctanh(+0.0+I*NaN) should be 0.0 + I*NaN (not NaN+I*NaN)</li>
<li>ctanh(+0.0+I*INF) should be 0.0 + I*NaN w/ invalid (not NaN+I*NaN w/ invalid)</li>
</ol>
<p>Reason for above two: Since ctanh(x+I*y) = (sinh(2x) + I*sin(2y)) /
(cosh(2x) + cos(2y)), for any rational number y, cos(2y) cannot be exactly -1,
so no 0/(1+(-1)),so no 0/0, so no NaN for the real component of the result</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add to G.6.2.1 cacosh before 4th bullet: cacosh(0.0+I*NaN) returns NaN +
I*pi/2</p>
<p>Add to G.6.2.1 cacosh 4th bullet: "non-zero" so it reads: cacosh(x + iNaN)
returns NaN + i*NaN and optionally raises the “invalid” floating-point
exception, for finite non-zero x.</p>
<p>Add to G.6.2.6 ctanh before 3rd bullet: ctanh(0.0+I*INF) returns 0.0+I*NAN
and raises the “invalid” floating-point exception.</p>
<p>Add to G.6.2.6 ctanh 3rd bullet: "non-zero" so it reads: ctanh(x + I*INF)
returns NaN + i*NaN and raises the “invalid” floating-point exception, for
finite non-zero x.</p>
<p>Add to G.6.2.6 ctanh before 4th bullet: ctanh(0.0+I*NaN) returns 0.0+I*NAN</p>
<p>Add to G.6.2.6 ctanh 4th bullet: "non-zero" so it reads: ctanh(x + I*NAN)
returns NaN + i*NaN and optionally raises the “invalid” floating-point

<h2>Issue 0472: Introduction to complex arithmetic in 7.3.1p3 wrong due to CMPLX</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The introduction to complex arithmetic in 7.3.1p3 is wrong on several counts,
all due to CMPLX.</p>
<p>The text in question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each synopsis specifies a family of functions consisting of a principal function
with one or more <strong>double complex</strong> parameters and a <strong>double complex</strong> or
<strong>double</strong> return value; and other functions with the same name but with <strong>f</strong>
and <strong>l</strong> suffixes which are corresponding functions with <strong>float</strong> and <strong>long
double</strong> parameters and return values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The items that are wrong are:</p>
<ul>
<li>CMPLX is a macro (not a function).</li>
<li>CMPLX takes <strong>double</strong> parameters (not <strong>double complex</strong>).</li>
<li>CMPLX has <strong>F</strong> and <strong>L</strong> suffixes (not <strong>f</strong> and <strong>l</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issue 0473: "A range error occurs if x is too large." is misleading</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>"A range error occurs if <strong>x</strong> is too large." is misleading (or ambiguous) for
expm1 (7.12.6.3p2), erfc (7.12.8.2p2), and lgamma (7.12.8.3p2).</p>
<p>"too large" could mean either +/-large value (in which case "too small" means
+/-near zero) or just +large value (in which case "too small" means -large
value).</p>
<p>7.12.6.3p2: expm1(-DBL_MAX) is -1, which is not a range error.</p>
<p>7.12.8.2p2: erfc(-DBL_MAX) is 2, which is not a range error.</p>
<p>7.12.8.3p2: lgamma(-DBL_MAX) is a pole error, which is not a range error.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add the word "positive" before <strong>x</strong> in those three cases so that they are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A range error occurs if positive <strong>x</strong> is too large.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>The goal for this note was to show that either object or expected was updated
rather than just being a conditional operation on object alone. It is being read
by some parties, however, to mean that atomic_compare_and_exchange is
intended to do bit comparison instead of value comparison. This is an erroneous
reading.</p>
<p>Consider first non-lock-free atomic types. These obviously require use of the
lock, whether inline or in an external table. So the first conclusion is that an
implementation must already select different implementations for these generic
functions based on whether the type is lock-free or not (ignoring lock bits
leads to data races). The basic algorithm is to take the lock on the target
object, extract and compare values with expected, and store or update desired as
appropriate, and release the lock. The extraction and comparison would likely be
done by the compiler through the use of type specific intrinsics that may or may
not get inlined by the optimizer.</p>
<p>Consider second the cases of padded integer types, padded struct or union types,
and float types.. All of these types have multiple bit representations for one
or more values and will fail erroneously when object and expected differ in
representation but not value. An implementation should, as for non-lock-free
data types, select an appropriate intrinsic to perform this operation. There are
two basic choices for the intrinsic. First, make all these atomic types locking,
and use the locking strategy already in place to attain the lock and extract and
compare the value bits appropriately. An alternate strategy might be to first
"normalize" *object and *expected, and then perform bitwise compare and
exchange.</p>
<p>To support this conclusion, I propose clarifying the note to apply to unpadded
lock-free integer types.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The 7.17 atomic library section of the standard and the syntax for atomic types
arose from different authors. The library section was adopted first and then
amended when the syntax proposal was approved during the development of the C11

types, including floats and bitfields.</p>
<p>There are a few unfortunate phrasings remaining in the <strong>7.17 Atomics

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The following sections discuss the C semantics of the <code>volatile</code> keyword and
show that they neither support existing practice nor, we believe, reflect the
intent of the committee when they were crafted. The Suggested Technical
Corrigendum then details changes to the C specification required to bring it
into harmony with both, as well as with C++.</p>
<h4>Motivation For Volatile</h4>
<p>The use case that motivated the introduction of the <code>volatile</code> keyword into C
was a variant of the following snippet copied from early UNIX sources [1]:</p>

</pre></div>

<p>The desired effect of the <code>while</code> loop in the <code>getchar()</code> function is to iterate
until the most significant (sign) bit of the keyboard status register mapped to
an address in memory represented by the <code>KL</code> macro (the address of the
memory-mapped <code>KBD_STAT</code> I/O register on the PDP-11) has become non-zero,
indicating that a key has been pressed, and then return the character value
extracted from the low 7 bits corresponding to the pressed key. In order for the
function to behave as expected, the compiler must emit an instruction to read a
value from the I/O register on each iteration of the loop. In particular, the
compiler must avoid caching the read value in a CPU register and substituting it
in subsequent accesses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in situations where the memory location doesn't correspond to
a special memory-mapped register, it's more efficient to avoid reading the value
from memory if it happens to already have been read into a CPU register, and
instead use the value cached in the CPU register.</p>
<p>The problem is that without some sort of notation (in K&amp;R C there was none)
there would be no way for a compiler to distinguish between these two cases. The
following paragraph quoted from <em>The C Programming Language, Second Edition</em>, by
Kernighan and Ritchie, explains the solution that was introduced into standard C
to deal with this problem: the <code>volatile</code> keyword.</p>

<p>The purpose of <code>volatile</code> is to force an implementation to suppress optimization
that could otherwise occur. For example, for a machine with memory-mapped
input/output, a pointer to a device register might be declared as a pointer to
<code>volatile</code>, in order to prevent the compiler from removing apparently redundant
references through the pointer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the <code>volatile</code> keyword, it should then be possible to rewrite the loop in
the snippet above as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">while</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #666666">*</span>(<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">volatile</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #666666">*</span>)<span style="color: #666666">&amp;</span>KL<span style="color: #666666">-&gt;</span>ks.lobyte<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&gt;=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span>);
</pre></div>

<p>or equivalently:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">volatile</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">*</span>lobyte<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&amp;</span>KL<span style="color: #666666">-&gt;</span>ks.lobyte;

</pre></div>

<p>and prevent the compiler from caching the value of the keyboard status register,
thus guaranteeing that the register will be read once in each iteration.</p>
<p>The difference between the two forms of the rewritten loop is of historical
interest: Early C compilers are said to have recognized the first pattern
(without the <code>volatile</code> keyword) where the address used to access the register
was a constant, and avoided the undesirable optimization for such accesses
[11]. However, they did not have the same ability when the access was through
pointer variable in which the address had been stored, especially not when the
use of such a variable was far removed from the last assignment to it. The
<code>volatile</code> keyword was intended to allow both forms of the loop to work as
expected.</p>
<p>The use case exemplified by the loop above has since become idiomatic and is
being extensively relied on in today's software even beyond reading I/O
registers.</p>
<p>As a representative example, consider the Linux kernel which relies on
<code>volatile</code> in its implementation of synchronization primitives such as spin
locks, or for performance counters. The variables that are operated on by these
primitives are typically declared to be of unqualified (i.e., non-volatile)
scalar types and allocated in ordinary memory. In serial code, for maximum
efficiency, each such variable is read and written just like any other variable,
with its value cached in a CPU register as compiler optimizations permit. At
well-defined points in the code where such a variable may be accessed by more
than one CPU at a time, the caching must be prevented and the variable must be
accessed using the special volatile semantics. To achieve that, the kernel
defines two macros: <code>READ_ONCE</code>, and <code>WRITE_ONCE</code>, in whose terms the primitives
are implemented. Each of the macros prevents the compiler optimization by
casting the address of its argument to a <code>volatile T*</code> and accessing the
variable via an lvalue of the <code>volatile</code>-qualified type <code>T</code> (where <code>T</code> is one of
the standard scalar types). Other primitives gurantee memory synchronization and
visibility but those are orthogonal to the subject of this paper. See [3].</p>
<p>Similar examples can be found in other system or embedded programs as well as in
many other pre-C11 and pre-C++11 code bases that don't rely on the Atomic
types and operations newly inroduced in those standards. They are often cited in
programming books [4] and in online articles [5, 6, 7, 8].</p>
<h4>The Trouble With Volatile</h4>
<p>In light of the motivation for the keyword and the wide-spread practice of
relying on its expected effect it might then come as a surprise that the C
standard lacks the necessary guarantees to support this popular idiom. In the
text of the C standard, volatile semantics are specified to apply to objects
explicitly declared with the qualifier. Quoting from §5.1.2.3, Program
execution, p2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, ... are all <em>side effects</em>,
which are changes in the state of the execution environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and p6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accesses to volatile objects are evaluated strictly according to the rules of
the abstract machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note in particular that the text refers to <ins>volatile objects</ins>, which
are defined as regions of storage storing the representation of their values.
Objects are distinct from expressions used to designate and access them. Such
expressions are referred to as <em>lvalues</em>, and may but don't need to mention the
name of the accessed object. However, since the words in the paragraphs above
don't mention lvalues the special volatile semantics don't apply to such
accessess. As a result, since the expression <code>*(volatile int*)&amp;KL-&gt;ks.lobyte</code> is
not an object but an lvalue of type <code>volatile int</code> that designates an object of
an otherwise unknown/unspecified type (the <code>KL</code> pointer doesn't point at an
object in the C sense), the volatile semantics do not apply to it. Consequently,
and due to §6.8.5, Iteration statements, p6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An iteration statement whose controlling expression is not a constant
expression, that ... does not access volatile objects ... may be assumed ... to
terminate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the controlling expression of the <code>while</code> loop is not required to be evaluated
with the special volatile semantics, allowing a C compiler to read the value of
the keyboard status register just once, and to return its value from the
function even if it's zero. (No known compiler has been observed to take
advantage of this permission.) This would obviously cause the <code>getchar</code> function
to behave in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>Although the problem with the C specification of volatile isn't well known, it
isn't new. It was pointed out in the past, for example in <em>The trouble with
volatile</em> [9], Jonathan Corbet quotes Linus Torvalds, the author and
maintainer of the Linux kernel, as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, more importantly, "<code>volatile</code>" is on the wrong <ins>part</ins> of the
whole system. In C, it's "data" that is volatile, but that is insane. Data isn't
volatile — <ins>accesses</ins> are volatile. So it may make sense to say "make
this particular <ins>access</ins> be careful", but not "make all accesses to
this data use some random strategy".</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Volatile In C++</h4>
<p>This problem is unique to the C standard. Unlike C, the text in the C++
standard avoids referring to volatile objects and instead refers to volatile
<em>glvalues</em>. (A <em>glvalue</em> is a C++ generalization of the C concept of
<em>lvalue</em>.) The C++ text that corresponds to the quote from §5.1.2.3 Program
execution, p2 of C11 above, in §1.9 Program execution, p12, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessing an object designated by a volatile <em>glvalue</em>, modifying an object, ...
are all side effects, which are changes in the state of the execution
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might be tempting to chalk up this differenc to a deliberate or accidental
diveregence of the C++ guarantees from C. But the C++ standard contains an
informative note in §7.1.6.1, The <em>cv-qualifiers</em>, p7, making it clear that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, the semantics of volatile are intended to be the same in C++ as
they are in C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This note which appears in the latest revision of C++ from 2014 dates back to
the first revision of the standard from 1998.</p>
<h4>Intended Semantics</h4>
<p>Besides the evidence above that the words in the C standard do not reflect
existing practice, there is also indication beyond the informative note in the
C++ standard that the words most likely do not reflect the original intent of
the committee at the time they were crafted.</p>
<p>The C99 Rationale [10], in §6.7.3 makes it clear that the committee's intent
when introducing <code>volatile</code> was to specify semantics that apply to accesses to
non-volatile objects via volatile-qualified lvalues and not just to accesses to
objects explicitly declared with the qualifier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The C89 Committee added to C two type qualifiers, <code>const</code> and <code>volatile</code>; ....
Individually and in combination they specify the assumptions a compiler can and
must make when accessing an object through an lvalue.</p>
<p>.... <code>volatile</code> and <code>restrict</code> are inventions of the Committee; and both follow
the syntactic model of <code>const</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: The syntactic model of <code>const</code> is to apply constness to accesses through
lvalues, regardless of whether or not the object being accessed has been
declared with a const-qualified type.)</p>
<p>The same section then further clarifies that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is necessary to access a non-<code>volatile</code> object using <code>volatile</code> semantics,
the technique is to cast the address of the object to the appropriate
pointer-to-qualified type, then dereference that pointer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The suggested technical corrigendum that follows brings the volatile
specification into alignment with existing practice, with their original intent,
and also with the C++ specification.</p>
<p>In §5.1.2.3, Program execution, p2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessing a<ins>n object through the use of an lvalue of volatile-qualified
type</ins><del>volatile object</del>, modifying a file, or calling a function
that does any of those operations are all side effects...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §5.1.2.3, Program execution, p4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can
deduce that its value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced
(including any caused by calling a function or accessing a<ins>n object through
the use of an lvalue of volatile-qualified type</ins><del>volatile
object</del>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §5.1.2.3, Program execution, p6, bullet 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accesses to <ins>objects through the use of lvalues of volatile-qualified
types</ins><del>volatile objects</del> are evaluated strictly according to the
rules of the abstract machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §6.7.3, Type qualifiers, p7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What constitutes an access to an object <ins>through the use of an lvalue
of</ins><del>that has</del> volatile-qualified type is implementation-defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §6.8.5, Iteration statements, p6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An iteration statement whose controlling expression is not a constant
expression,<sup>156)</sup> that performs no input/output operations, does not
access <ins>objects through the use of lvalues of volatile-qualified types</ins>
<del>volatile objects</del>, ... may be assumed by the implementation to
terminate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §J.3.10, Qualifiers, p1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What constitutes an access to an object <ins>through the use of an lvalue
of</ins><del>that has</del> volatile-qualified type (6.7.3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §L.2.1, p1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>out-of-bounds store</p>
<p>an (attempted) access (3.1) that, at run time, for a given computational state,
would modify (or, for an <del>object declared</del><ins>lvalue of</ins>
volatile<ins>-qualified type</ins>, fetch) one or more bytes that lie outside
the bounds permitted by this Standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comment from WG14 on 2018-10-18:</p>
<p>Oct 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The premise of this DR is essentially that the original specification of <code>volatile</code> did not accurately reflect the intent at the time of its formulation and that ongoing practice has in fact implemented the intent. On the basis that the intent was clearly established and that practice corroborates it, the committee accepted this as a defect and moreover concluded that it is in substantial agreement.</li>
<li>Although asked, the committee did not spend any time answering the question as to why such a defect had never before been reported. All implementors represented on the committee were polled and all confirmed that indeed, the intent, not the standard, is implemented. In addition to the linux experience documented in the paper, at least two committee members described discussions with systems engineers where this difference between the standard vs the implementation was discussed because the systems engineers clearly depended on the implementation of actual intent. The sense was that this was simply a well known discrepency.</li>
<li>Specifically, the intent is reflected in the implementations of the gcc, Intel, clang, sparc, and IBM compilers. Although far from a complete enumeration of C compilers, these were broad enough to accept that all known compilers that the committee could speak to that are used for systems implementation in fact implement the intent, not the standard.</li>
<li>The committee also believes that C++ “got this (nearly) right” and that there will likely be a liaison issue on this topic.</li>
<li>The committee feels that the changes proposed to 5.1.2.3p6 bullet 1 are the “heart of the matter”. There was a suggestion that editorially, it might be worthwhile to define a new term <em>volatile access</em> at that point and use it consistently in the other parts of the standard rather than as proposed in the suggested technical corrigendum. This suggestion and other comments can also be found in <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13870">(SC22WG14.13870) N1956 volatile semantics</a>. This rephrasing of the proposed changes could eliminate potential confusion when introduced elsewhere.</li>
<li>The author was asked to revise his wordings through soliciting input either directly from committee members or indirectly through the use of the WG14 reflector and to formulate and submit a new paper on this topic.</li>

<h2>Issue 0477: <code>nan</code> should take a string argument</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Martin Sebor<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Description for the <code>nan(const char *tagp)</code> function reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The call <code>nan("</code><em>n-char-sequence</em><code>")</code> is equivalent to
<code>strtod("NAN(</code><em>n-char-sequence</em><code>)", (char**) NULL)</code>; the call <code>nan("")</code> is
equivalent to <code>strtod("NAN()", (char**) NULL)</code>. If <code>tagp</code> does not point to an
<em>n-char sequence</em> or an empty string, the call is equivalent to <code>strtod("NAN", (char**) NULL).</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <em>n-char sequence</em> is a string of an implementation-defined form.</p>
<p>§7.1.4, Use of library functions, requires that arguments to library functions
must have valid values. Specifically, pointers must not be null or point outside
the address space of the program. In addition, arguments described as arrays
(including strings) must be such that all address computations and accesses to
objects that would be valid if the pointer argument did point to the first
element of such an array are in fact valid.</p>
<p>Since <code>tagp</code> argument is not required to point to a string or array, only the
first condition in §7.1.4 applies: it must not point outside the address space
of the program or be null.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the snippet below, since <code>tagp</code> is a valid pointer that does not
point to an <em>n-char-sequence</em> or the empty string, the <code>nan</code> call is valid and
required to be be equivalent to <code>strtod("NAN", (char**) NULL).</code></p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #B00040">char</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>c<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;1&#39;</span>;<span style="color: #bbbbbb">   </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">// not a n-char-sequence (no terminating NUL)</span>
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #B00040">char</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">*</span>tagp<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">&amp;</span>c;

</pre></div>

<p>But for an implementation that recognizes <em>n-char-sequences</em> of length greater
than 1 the requirement to determine whether <code>tagp</code> points to one is impossible
to implement since to do so <code>nan</code> would have to attempt to read past the end of
<code>c</code>.</p>
<p>It seems obvious that this is not intended and that the standard text is simply
missing a requirement that the <code>tagp</code> argument point to a string.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The solution is to require the argument to the <code>nan</code> family of functions to be a
pointer to a string, analogously to all other library functions that operate on
strings.</p>
<p>Change §7.12.11.2 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><ins>The <code>nan</code>, <code>nanf</code>, and <code>nanl</code> functions convert the string pointed to by
<code>tagp</code> according to the following rules.</ins> The call
<code>nan("</code><em>n-char-sequence</em><code>")</code> is equivalent to
<code>strtod("NAN(</code><em>n-char-sequence</em><code>)", (char**) NULL)</code>; the call <code>nan("")</code> is
equivalent to <code>strtod("NAN()", (char**) NULL)</code>. If <code>tagp</code> does not point to an
<em>n-char sequence</em> or an empty string, the call is equivalent to <code>strtod("NAN", (char**) NULL).</code></p>

<h2>Issue 0478: valid uses of the <code>main</code> function</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Martin Sebor<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The text of the standard isn't entirely clear as to whether or not the function
<code>main</code> can be used by strictly conforming C programs in hosted environments. The
following passages quote the permissions and requirements that at the same time
suggest that <code>main</code> may not be used by such programs, and that there may be more
than the one call to the function made by the implementation at program startup.</p>
<p>§5.1.2.2.2 Program execution says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a hosted environment, a program may use all the functions, macros, type
definitions, and objects described in the library clause (clause 7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>suggesting that, since <code>main</code> is not described in the library clause but rather
in §5.1.2.2.1, it may not be used by a program.</p>
<p>However, §5.1.2.2.3 Program termination, immediately following the section
quoted above, then goes on to state (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the return type of the <code>main</code> function is a type compatible with <code>int</code>, a
return from the <strong>initial call</strong> to the <code>main</code> function is equivalent to calling
the <code>exit</code> function with the value returned by the <code>main</code> function as its
argument; ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, §7.21.3 Files contains the following sentence (emphasis also
added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the <code>main</code> function returns to <strong>its original caller</strong>, all open files are
closed...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, since the C++ standard explicitly prohibits programs from calling or
otherwise using <code>main</code>, one might expect C to do the same. However the
references to <code>main</code>'s initial call and its original caller in the latter two
paragraphs suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>The question was raised and discussed on the committee's mailing list starting
with message <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13780">(SC22WG14.13780) valid uses of
main</a>. In response, members of
the committee who participated in the preparation of the version of the C
standard that introduced the words clarified that the intent was and remains for
C to allow programs to use <code>main</code>. In particular, the intent of §5.1.2.2.2
Program execution is to grant permission to programs to use the facilities of
the standard library but not to preclude the uses of <code>main</code> or other symbols
defined by them.</p>
<p>However, since the function <code>main</code> is special and unlike any other symbol
defined by a program, and since C++ contains a rule to the contrary, we feel
that the intent isn't sufficiently clearly and unambiguously reflected in the
quoted passages or the rest of the standard, and that a clarification is called
for.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In light of the intent of the passages quoted above as made clear by the mailing
list discussion, we offer two proposals to clarify the text of the standard.</p>
<h4>Proposal 1</h4>
<p>Change §5.1.2.2.2 Program execution as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a hosted environment, a program may use <ins>the function <code>main</code> as well
as</ins> all the functions, macros, type definitions, and objects described in
the library clause (clause 7).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Proposal 2</h4>
<p>Add a footnote to the end of §5.1.2.2.2 Program execution, with the following
text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><ins>A program may also use the function <code>main</code>.</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee does not agree that any further clarification is needed in the
standard. We know of no actual confusion in a practical sense on this matter. As
such, the committee agrees with and draws substantially from <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13780">(SC22WG14.13787)
RE: RE: RE: valid uses of main</a>
in the formulation of its Proposed Committee Response below.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As there is no "only" in 5.1.2.2.2 the interpretation should be that the
statement is granting permission, not making a restriction. It is drawing a
distinction between freestanding environments, where only a subset of the
library can be used, and hosted environments, where all of the library can be
used. Programs are always free, in either kind of environment, to use things in
addition to the library, like their own functions and objects. Additionally, the
reference in 5.1.2.2.3 to the <strong>initial</strong> call to <code>main</code> strongly suggests that
recursive calls are allowed.</p>

<h2>Issue 0479: unclear specification of <code>mtx_trylock</code> on non-recursive muteness</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Torvald Riegel, Martin Sebor<br />
Date: 2015-09-25<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1963.htm">N1963</a><br />

Converted from: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2396.htm">n2396.htm</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The specification of <code>mtx_trylock</code> if applied to a non-recursive mutex is not
clear. Whereas it is spelled out for <code>mtx_lock</code> that a thread must not attempt
to lock a non-recursive mutex more than once, there is no such requirement for
<code>mtx_trylock</code>. The existing wording for <code>mtx_trylock</code> could be understood as
requiring <code>mtx_trylock</code> to fail; however, that would defeat the purpose of
separating recursive from non-recursive mutexes because it would require
implementations to track which thread owns the mutex.</p>
<p>(It might also be good if the standard would define what recursive locking
actually is, but this is outside of the focus of this paper.)</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The standard should specify the requirement for <code>mtx_lock</code> explicitly for
<code>mtx_trylock</code> as well. Specifically, add the following sentence to 7.26.4.5p2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the mutex is non-recursive, it shall not be locked by the calling thread.</p>

<li>The committee agrees that this clarification would be useful, that is, that <code>mtx_trylock</code> should fail if attempted on an already held non-recursive mutex. We did not agree that the Proposed Technical Corrigendum addressed this defect correctly.</li>
<li>Coordinated new wording is solicited from the authors to both this and the solicited author for the resolution of <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0469">DR 469</a> since it also is proposing potentially overlapping wording changes in this area.</li>

<p>As discussed in committee, an approach for resolving copying that parallels FILE
treatment will be considered. In that case, 7.21.3p6 is germaine:</p>

<p>The address of a <code>FILE</code> object used to control a stream may be significant; a
copy of a <code>FILE</code> object need not serve in place of the original.</p>

<h2>Issue 0480: <code>cnd_wait</code> and <code>cnd_timewait</code> should allow spurious wake-ups</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Torvald Riegel, Martin Sebor<br />
Date: 2015-09-25<br />

Fixed in: C17<br />
Converted from: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2396.htm">n2396.htm</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Both ISO C++ and POSIX allow for spurious wake-ups from their condition
variable wait functions. However, C11 has no wording that would allow that.
(This applies to both <code>cnd_wait</code> and <code>cnd_timewait</code>, but just <code>cnd_wait</code> is
referred to in what follows.)</p>
<p>If spurious wake-ups are allowed, then some implementations become significantly
easier; it also allows to implement the C standard on top of POSIX using just a
thin wrapper. In contrast, implementing a condition variable that does not allow
spurious wake-ups on top of a condition variable implementation that does allow
that is likely close to implementing a condition variable from scratch in terms
of complexity.</p>
<p>Another reason for allowing spurious wake-ups is that to actually exploit having
no spurious wake-ups, a program needs to take quite some care to establish the
happens-before relations required to make just the return from <code>cnd_wait</code> mean
something that can be used to infer something about the then current state of
memory (for example, if the wake-up is supposed to also mean that some state has
been initialized).</p>
<p>Specifically, the program must make sure that it actually calls <code>cnd_signal</code> (or
<code>cnd_broadcast</code>) after <code>cnd_wait</code> has started to block; this can be ensured by
calling <code>cnd_signal</code> from a critical section protected by the same mutex as
supplied to the respective <code>cnd_wait</code>, and checking the ordering of the
<code>cnd_wait</code> and <code>cnd_signal</code> critical sections in some way (e.g., through access
to variables protected by the same mutex, or by not letting the signaling thread
enter the <code>cnd_signal</code> critical section before the <code>cnd_wait</code> critical section).
Second, <code>cnd_wait</code> is not specified to synchronize with <code>cnd_signal</code>, so either
<code>cnd_signal</code> must be in such a critical section (ie, there is a second reason
for that), or the signaler and the waiter must establish a happens-before
relation through other means such as atomics.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Change this sentence from the specification of <code>cnd_wait</code> (7.26.3.6p2):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cnd_wait function atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mtx and
endeavors to block until the condition variable pointed to by cond is signaled
by a call to cnd_signal or to cnd_broadcast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cnd_wait function atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mtx and
endeavors to block until the condition variable pointed to by cond is signaled
by a call to cnd_signal or to cnd_broadcast, or until it is unblocked due to a
spurious, unspecified reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise for <code>cnd_timedwait</code>.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a follow up of the now closed DR 423 which resulted in the clarification
of the status of qualifications of rvalues.</p>
<p>This defect report aims to clarify the status of the controlling expression of
<code>_Generic</code> primary expression:</p>
<p><em><strong>Does the controlling expression of a <code>_Generic</code> primary expression undergo
any type of conversion to calculate the type that is used to do the
selection?</strong></em></p>
<p>Implementers have given different answers to this question; gcc (<em>choice 1</em> in
the following) on one side and clang and IBM (<em>choice 2</em>) on the other side went
quite opposite ways, resulting in severe incompatibility for <code>_Generic</code>
expression that use qualifiers or arrays.</p>

<p>The last two lines, where gcc and clang agree, points to the nature of the
problem: gcc treats all such expressions as rvalues and does all applicable
conversions of 6.3.2.1, that is lvalue to rvalue and array to pointer
conversions. clang treats them as lvalues.</p>
<h3>Problem discussion</h3>
<p>The problem arises to know whether or not the conversions of 6.3 apply to the
controlling expression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>promotions:</strong> There is no general rule to which expressions these apply, but their application is hard coded for the individual operators, where it makes reference to "its (promoted) operand".</li>
<li><strong>lvalue conversion:</strong> I didn't find any text that would impose lvalue conversion performed to the controlling expression. All wording in 6.3 is "some" and "may". Also it talks of "operators" and "operations", but <code>_Generic</code> is not an operator, but a primary expression. The wording in 6.5.1.1 is <em>has a type</em> and doesn't make any reference to type conversion.</li>
<li><strong>array conversion:</strong> The support for array conversion is stronger. Array conversion has an explicit list of cases (<em>6.3.2.1 p3</em>) were an array is an <em>operand</em> where it doesn't apply. But
<ul>
<li>The case of arrays as an exception in <em>6.3.2.1 p3</em> doesn't list the <em>associations</em> of <code>_Generic</code> either, which are listed in <em>6.5.1.1</em>.</li>
<li>There is another precedent, namely <em>parenthesized expressions</em>, which are also not listed in <em>6.3.2.1 p3</em> and where nobody expects an array conversion, either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Integer promotions</h4>
<p>Applying promotions would have as an effect that we wouldn't be able to
distinguish narrow integer types from <code>int</code>. There is no indication that the
text implies that form or conversion, nor that anybody has proposed to use
<code>_Generic</code> like this.</p>
<h4>Choice 1: Consequences of lvalue conversion</h4>
<p>All conversion in <em>6.3.2.1 p2</em> describe what would in normal CS language be
named the evaluation of an object. It has no provision to apply it to types
alone. In particular it includes the special clause that uninitialized
<code>register</code> variables lead to undefined behavior when undergoing lvalue
conversion. As a consequence:</p>
<p><em>Any lvalue conversion of an uninitialized <code>register</code> variable leads to
undefined behavior.</em></p>
<p>And thus</p>
<p><em><strong>Under the hypothesis that the controlling expression undergoes lvalue
conversion, any <code>_Generic</code> primary expression that uses an uninitialized
<code>register</code> variable as controlling expression leads to undefined behavior.</strong></em></p>
<h4>Choice 2: Consequences not doing conversions</h4>
<p>In view of the resolution of DR 423 (rvalues drop qualifiers) using <code>_Generic</code>
primary expressions with objects in controlling expression may have results that
appear surprising.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define F(X) _Generic((X), char const: 0, char: 1, int: 2)</span>

F(strc[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>])<span style="color: #bbbbbb">   </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">// -&gt; 0</span>
F(<span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;&quot;</span>[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>])<span style="color: #bbbbbb">     </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">// -&gt; 1</span>
F(<span style="color: #666666">+</span>strc[<span style="color: #666666">0</span>])<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">// -&gt; 2</span>
</pre></div>

<p>So the problem is here, that there is no type agnostic operator that results in
a simple lvalue conversion for <code>char const</code> objects to <code>char</code>; all such
operators also promote <code>char</code> to <code>int</code>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Under the hypothesis that the controlling expression doesn't undergo
conversion, any <code>_Generic</code> primary expression that uses a qualified lvalue of
narrow type <code>T</code> can't directly trigger the association for <code>T</code> itself.</strong></em></p>
<h4>non-equivalence of the two approaches</h4>
<p>For many areas the two approaches are feature equivalent, that is both allow to
implement the same semantic concepts, but with different syntax. Rewriting code
that was written with one of choices in mind to the other choice is in general
not straight forward and probably can't be automated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code that was written with <em>choice 1</em> in mind (enforced lvalue and array conversion) when translated to <em>choice 2</em> has to enforce such conversions. E.g as long as we know that the type of <code>X</code> is only a wide integer type or an array or pointer type, a macro such as</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">        </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define bla(X) _Generic((X), ... something ... )</span>
</pre></div>

<p>would have to become</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">        </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define bla(X) _Generic((X)+0, ... something ... )</span>

<p>Writing code that takes care of narrow integer types is a bit more difficult, but can be done with 48 extra case selections, taking care of all narrow types (6) and all their possible qualifications (8, <code>restrict</code> is not possible, here). Code that uses <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> types must use bizarre things like <code>1 ? (X) : (X)</code> to enforce lvalue conversion.</p>

<p>Code that was written with <em>choice 2</em> in mind (no lvalue or array conversion) when translated to <em>choice 1</em> has to pass to a setting where qualifiers and arrays are preserved in the type. The only such setting is the address-of operator <code>&amp;</code>.</p>

<span style="color: #9C6500">          ...)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>That is each individual type selection has to be transformed, and the syntactical change that is to be apply is no simple textual replacement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application work around</h3>
<p>Since today C implementations have already taken different paths for this
feature, applications should be careful when using <code>_Generic</code> to remain in the
intersection of these two interpretations. A certain number of design questions
should be answered when implementing a type generic macro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I want to differentiate the outcome according to the qualification of the argument?</li>
<li>Do I want to distinguish arrays from pointer arguments?</li>
<li>Do I want to distinguish narrow types?</li>
<li>Do I want to apply it to composite types, namely <code>struct</code> types?</li>
</ul>
<p>The following lists different strategies for common scenarios, that can be used
to code type generic macros that will work with both of the choices 1 or 2.</p>
<h4>Wide integers and floating point types</h4>
<p>This is e.g the case of the C library interfaces in <code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code>. If we know
that the possible type of the argument is restricted in such a way, the easiest
is to apply the unary plus operator <code>+</code>, as in</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define F(X) _Generic(+(X),             \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    default: doubleFunc,                  \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    int: intFunc,                         \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    ...                                   \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    _Complex long double: cldoubleFunc)(X)</span>

<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define fabs(X) _Generic(+(X),          \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    default: fabs,                        \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    float: fabsf,                         \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    long double: fabsl)(X)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This <code>+</code> sign ensures an lvalue to rvalue conversion, and, that it will error
out at compilation time for pointer types or arrays. It also forcibly promotes
narrow integer types, usually to <code>int</code>. For the later case of <code>fabs</code> all integer
types will map to the <code>double</code> version of the function, and the argument will
eventually be converted to <code>double</code> before the call is made.</p>
<h4>Adding pointer types and converting arrays</h4>
<p>If we also want to capture pointer types <em>and</em> convert arrays to pointers, we
should use <code>+0</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define F(X) _Generic((X)+0),           \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    default: doubleFunc,                  \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char*: stringFunc,                    \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char const*: stringFunc,              \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    int: intFunc,                         \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    ...                                   \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    _Complex long double: cldoubleFunc)(X)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This binary <code>+</code> ensures that any array is first converted to a pointer; the
properties of <code>0</code> ensure that this constant works well with all the types that
are to be captured, here. It also forcibly promotes narrow integer types,
usually to <code>int</code>.</p>
<h4>Converting arrays, only</h4>
<p>If we k now that a macro will only be used for array and pointer types, we can
use the <code>[]</code> operator:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define F(X) _Generic(&amp;((X)[0]),        \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char*: stringFunc,                    \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char const*: stringFunc,              \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    wchar_t*: wcsFunc,                    \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    ...                                   \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    )(X)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This operator only applies to array or to pointer types and would error if
present with any integer type.</p>
<h4>Using qualifiers of types or arrays</h4>
<p>If we want a macro that selects differently according to type qualification or
according to different array size, we can use the <code>&amp;</code> operator:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define F(X) _Generic(&amp;(X),        \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char**: stringFunc,              \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char(*)[4]: string4Func,         \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char const**: stringFunc,        \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    char const(*)[4]: string4Func,   \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    wchar_t**: wcsFunc,              \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    ...                              \</span>
<span style="color: #9C6500">    )(X)</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>Possible solutions</h3>
<p>The above discussion describes what can be read from the text of C11, alone, and
not the intent of the committee. I think if the committee would have wanted a
<em>choice 2</em>, the standard text would not have looked much different than what we
have, now. Since also the intent of the committee to go for <em>choice 1</em> seems not
to be very clear from any additional text (minutes of the meetings, e.g) I think
the reading of <em>choice 2</em> should be the preferred one.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (any choice)</h3>
<p>Amend the list in footnote 121 for objects with <code>register</code> storage class. Change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the only operators that can be applied to an array declared with
storage-class specifier <code>register</code> are <code>sizeof</code> and <code>_Alignof</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><ins>Thus, an identifier with array type and declared with storage-class
specifier <code>register</code> may only appear in primary expressions and as operand to
<code>sizeof</code> and <code>_Alignof</code>.</ins></p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (Choice 2)</h3>
<p>Change 6.5.1.1 p3, first sentence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The controlling expression of a generic selection is not evaluated <ins>and the
type of that expression is used without applying any conversions described in
Section 6.3</ins>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add <code>_Generic</code> to the exception list in <em>6.3.2.1 p3</em> to make it clear that array
to pointer conversion applies to none of the controlling or association
expression if they are lvalues of array type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Except when it is <ins>the controlling expression or an association expression
of a <code>_Generic</code> primary expression, or is</ins> the operand of the <code>sizeof</code>
operator, the <code>_Alignof</code> operator, or the unary <code>&amp;</code> operator, or is a string
literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type “array of type”
is converted to an expression with type “pointer to type” that points to the
initial element of the array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object
has register storage class, the behavior is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also add a forward reference to <code>_Generic</code> in 6.3.2.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (Choice 1)</h3>
<p>If the intent of the committee had been <em>choice 1</em> or similar, bigger changes of
the standard would be indicated. I only list some of the areas that would need
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move <code>_Generic</code> from primary expressions to a proper subsection, and rename the feature to <code>_Generic</code> operator.</li>
<li>Clarify which <em>as-if</em> conversions must be applied to determine the type.</li>
<li>Reformulate those conversions as conversions of types instead of values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, add <code>_Generic</code> to the exception list in <em>6.3.2.1 p3</em> to make it clear that
array to pointer conversion applies to none of the association expression if
they are lvalues of array type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Except when it is <ins>an association expression of a <code>_Generic</code> expression, or
is</ins> the operand of the <code>sizeof</code> operator, the <code>_Alignof</code> operator, or the
unary <code>&amp;</code> operator, or is a string literal used to initialize an array, an
expression that has type “array of type” is converted to an expression with type
“pointer to type” that points to the initial element of the array object and is
not an lvalue. If the array object has register storage class, the behavior is
undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (Status quo)</h3>
<p>A third possibility would be to leave this leeway to implementations. I strongly
object to that, but if so, I would suggest to add a phrase to 6.5.1.1 p3 like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... in the default generic association. <ins>Whether or not the type of the
controlling expression is determined as if any of conversions described in
Section 6.3 are applied is implementation defined.</ins> None of the expressions
...</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>This paper elicited a long and productive discussion. The committee agrees with the author of the <code>_Generic</code> proposal that the intent was that selecting on qualified types was explicitly to be avoided as was selecting on arrays by size. The intent of <code>_Generic</code> was to give C a mechanism to somewhat express the notion of “overloaded function” found in C++, and in particular a possible mechanism for implementors to use to implement the atomic type generic functions from section 7.17.7. Although this sentiment is most closely reflected in Choice 1 above, and it is reported that clang has also now adopted that approach, the committee feels that the wording in the Suggested Technical Corrigendum is not appropriate.</li>
<li>The sentiment of the committee is to state that the type of arrays should decay into pointers in the controlling expression of a <code>_Generic</code> primary expression.</li>
<li>The sentiment of the committee is that a better approach to the lvalue conversion issue is to revise 6.5.1.1p2 by adding something along the lines of
<blockquote>
<p>The type of the controlling expression of a generic selection is the unqualified
type determined by applying the lvalue conversions described in 6.3.2.1p2 as if
by evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The author is requested to incorporate this feedback into a new proposal and is encouraged to solicit input directly from committee members and on the WG14 reflector.</li>
</ul>

<p>The paper <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2001.pdf">N2001</a>
was presented and, with revision, adopted as the Proposed Technical Corrigendum
below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2016 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It was noted that bitfields are of integer type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In §6.5.1.1p2 change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The controlling expression of a generic selection shall have type compatible
with at most one of the types named in its generic association list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The type of the controlling expression is the type of the expression as if it
had undergone an lvalue conversion<sup>new</sup>, array to pointer conversion,
or function to pointer conversion. That type shall be compatible with at most
one of the types named in the generic association list.</p>
<p><sup>new)</sup>lvalue conversion drops type qualifiers.</p>

<p>There already are some ways to have a macro invocation be split over two files
that result in undefined behaviour.</p>
<p>5.1.1.2 Translation phases, paragraph 1, bullet 2 has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character, which shall
not be immediately preceded by a backslash character before any such splicing
takes place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which makes using line splicing (as a way to split a macro invocation over many
files) undefined.</p>
<p>6.10.3 Macro replacement, paragraph 11 has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there are sequences of preprocessing tokens within the list of arguments that
would otherwise act as preprocessing directives,172) the behavior is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which makes using #include of arguments (as a way to split a macro invocation
over many files) between the outside-most matching parentheses undefined.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add to 5.1.1.2, paragraph 1, bullet 3, words along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A macro invocation shall be contained within one source file.</p>

noted that function invocations are allowed to span files and that there are

original specification and may consider adding such restrictions in a possible
future revision of the Standard, and will record this intent in the next

<p>However, 7.2.1.1 requires that the <strong>assert</strong> macro write information about the
call that has a false expression. That information includes the __LINE__ and
__FILE__ preprocessing macros. So, there is a requirement that this specific
macro using __LINE__ and __FILE__ have the line number and file name of
the invocation, not the line number and file name of the replacment list (in
&lt;assert.h&gt;).</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add to 6.10.8.1, paragraph 1, item __LINE__:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The line number associated with a __LINE__ in a macro replacment list is the
line number of the macro invocation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add to 6.10.8.1, paragraph 1, item __FILE__:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The source file name associated with a __FILE__ in a macro replacment list
is the source file name of the macro invocation.</p>

<h2>Issue 0484: invalid characters in <code>strcoll()</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Fred J. Tydeman<br />
Date: 2015-06-23<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1944.htm">N1944</a><br />

Converted from: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2396.htm">n2396.htm</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>7.24.4.3 strcoll makes the assumption that the result of comparing two strings
can only have one of three outcomes: greater than, equal to, or less than.
However, there is a fourth outcome that is possible: not comparable.</p>
<p>I have been told that there are locales or codesets that have strings of bytes
that do not form valid characters. Those invalid characters could be considered
Not-a-Character (similar to Not-a-Number for floating-point). And, they are not
comparable to anything.</p>
<p>I do not know if the same issue can apply to wchar_t. If so, then 7.29.4.4.1
wcscmp(), 7.29.4.4.3 wcsncmp(), and 7.29.4.4.5 wmemcmp() have the same problem.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Replace the start of 7.24.4.3, paragraph 3,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>strcoll</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If either string contains invalid characters, <strong>errno</strong> is set to an
implementation defined value and the return value is unspecified; otherwise,
<strong>errno</strong> is left alone and the <strong>strcoll</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same change should also be applied to 7.29.4.4.2 wcscoll.</p>
<hr />
<p>Comment from WG14 on 2016-10-21:</p>
<p>Oct 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee agrees that the standard does not specify behavior under these
conditions and as such there is undefined behavior by way of §7.1.4p1 “If an
argument to a function has an invalid value … the behavior is undefined”. There
is strong sentiment to keep the library fast and that imposing new requirements
to set <code>errno</code> is to be generally avoided. Whereas POSIX does define behavior
that sets <code>errno</code> under these conditions, it is explicitly the intent of the
committee to leave such behavior undefined in the standard to allow such
refinements by others.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>By way of §7.1.4p1 “If an argument to a function has an invalid value … the
behavior is undefined” the behavior of <code>strcoll</code> in the face of invalid input is
already clearly undefined. The committee wishes to leave it so specified. This
latitude allows POSIX to further refine the semantics according to their needs.
We therefore do not accept the Proposed Technical Corrigendum.</p>

<h2>Issue 0485: Problem with the specification of <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Jens Gustedt<br />
Date: 2015-08-07<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The current version of the standard states that the argument to this macro
should be a value of the corresponding base type of the atomic object that is to
be initialized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro expands to a token sequence suitable for
initializing an atomic object of a type that is initialization-compatible with
value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is problematic, because it excludes the primary form of initializers, the
<code>{ }</code> form, from the possible uses, that would be necessary to initialize
<code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> types properly.</p>
<p><strong>Problem discussion</strong></p>
<p>As a consequence, there is a problem for atomic objects that combine the two
properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>The base type is a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type.</li>
<li>The object has static or thread-local storage duration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is, that for such types there are no compile time constants that
could be used as <em>value</em>, here. As a consequence the standard <em>doesn't allow
explicit initialization</em> for these objects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Atomic objects of <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type and static or thread-local storage duration can only be default initialized.</li>
<li>At program and thread startup, respectively, atomic objects of <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type and static or thread-local storage duration are in an indeterminate state.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an important drawback that doesn't seem to be intentional:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> had exactly been introduce for the purpose of initializing objects of static storage to a valid state with known value.</li>
<li><code>struct</code> atomics play an important role for lock-free data structures to avoid the ABA problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current practice</strong></p>
<p>Both compilers that I have my hands on (gcc 4.9 and clang 3.6) that implement
<code>&lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</code> have something equivalent to</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(VALUE)  (VALUE)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is of course conforming to the standard text as it is now, but exhibit the
exact problem. They don't allow for a compile time initializer since the <code>()</code>
around <code>VALUE</code> result in invalid syntax if <code>VALUE</code> is a <code>{ }</code> initializer.</p>
<p>Clang has an implementation specific way out of this: they allow compound
literals with constant initializers in that context. Gcc provides no such
solution.</p>
<p>For both compilers, it is easily possible to overwrite the macro definition into
one that omits the parenthesis and all works fine.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Change the beginning of the corresponding section, 7.17.2.1p2, to:</p>
<p><ins>7.17.2.1 The <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro<br />
<strong>Synopsis</strong></ins></p>
<p><ins><code>#include &lt;stdatomic.h&gt;</code><br />
<code>#define ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(initializer)</code></ins></p>
<p><ins><strong>Description</strong><br />
The <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro expands to a token sequence suitable for
initializing an atomic object <code>X</code>. For any invocation of this macro, the
<em>initializer</em> argument shall expand to a token sequence that would be suitable
to initialize <code>X</code> if the atomic qualification would be dropped.<strong>footnote</strong>That
is, it could be used to initialize an object <code>Y</code> of the same base type, storage
duration and place of declaration as <code>X</code>, but without atomic qualification.<strong>end
footnote</strong><br />
An atomic object with automatic storage duration ...</ins></p>
<p>Then append a new note after the actual para 4:</p>
<p><ins><em>Note:</em> Since <em>initializer</em> may be a token sequence that contains commas
which are not protected by <code>()</code> it may constitute a variable number of arguments
for the macro evaluation. Implementations should be able to deal with such
situations by defining <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> as accepting a variable argument
list.</ins></p>
<hr />
<p>Comment from WG14 on 2017-11-03:</p>
<p>Oct 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The fundamental issue is the apparent inability to initialize atomic structures or unions due to the definition of the <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro as taking a single argument. Some implementations have already taken the liberty of treating the macro as variadic for purposes of atomic structure initialization and moreover to also implicitly provide surrounding <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> that form the syntax for a structure initializer or compound literal as appropriate to the implementation.</li>
<li>The committee agrees with the sentiment expressed in the suggested NOTE although the wording was not discussed.</li>
<li>The suggested changes to 7.17.2.1 were not acceptable to the committee, however, and may not be needed at all since, in particular the declared type <code>C</code> is already the non-atomic version of the atomic type <code>A</code> of the variable being initialized. Use of the term “base type” is undefined in C for example.</li>
<li>The committee requests that the author take this input under advisement in a new solicited paper that would, in effect, make explicit the extended practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apr 2016 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A short paper was provided with a Suggested Technical Corrigendum and, although
close, more work was solicited from the authors. The direction discussed by the
committee was given that in the section <code>C</code> is defined to be the non-atomic
equivalent of type <code>A</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new wording must be provided to say it takes an initializer for an object of type <code>C</code>, and the macro expands to an object of type <code>A</code>, and that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the macro can be defined as in the Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #9C6500">#define ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(...)</span>
</pre></div>

</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2016 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The definition of <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> as a macro is problematic. Several
implementations use locks introduced by compiler magic for larger structures and
the macro cannot provide for the proper initialization of a lock that is not
visible. For these and other implementations, <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> should be fully
implemented as compiler magic.</p>
<p>Since removing the definition of the macro is outside the scope of a DR, this
issue may only be addressable in a future revision of the standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apr 2017 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Although discussed at the last meeting, the point that there are no known
implementations using <em>embedded</em> locks was not accurately reflected in the prior
discussion. Atomic structures may still differ in size due to potentially
increased alignment requirements. It was further noted that some implementations
use "compiler magic" at initialization time.</p>
<p>Since the macro definition is neither necessary nor sufficient for structures,
the email <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14645">(SC22WG14.14645) DR 485 wording for TC
2017</a> containing two suggested
technical corrigenda was discussed at some length. Neither change, however, is
appropriate as a technical corrigendum, and as such this issue cannot be
addressed using the Defect Report process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro was added to the standard without wide
implementation experience with the intent being to allow implementations to use
embedded locks in atomic types. It was not, however, well formulated to
accommodate the extension of atomics to structures since it would, perhaps,
require variadic arguments. No known implementations use embedded locks,
however, and as such there is no technical requirement for the use of the
<code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro.</p>
<p>Correcting this is beyond the scope of the Defect Report process.</p>
<p>There was consensus in the committee to deprecate this macro in the next
revision of the standard. The following words, drawn from <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14645">(SC22WG14.14645) DR
485 wording for TC 2017</a>, are the
proposed direction:</p>
<p>In §7.17.2.1 replace paragraph 2 with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An atomic object with automatic storage duration that is not explicitly
initialized is initially in an indeterminate state.</p>

<h2>Issue 0486: Inconsistent specification for arithmetic on atomic objects</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Jens Gustedt<br />
Date: 2015-08-07<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Whereas its intent is clear, the text in the C standard that concerns atomics
has several consistency problems. There are contradictions and the standard
vocabulary is not always applied correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Problem discussion</strong></p>
<p><em>— Memory order of operators —</em></p>
<p>The following sections on arithmetic operators, all specify that if they are
applied to an atomic object as an operand of <strong>any</strong> arithmetic base type, the
memory order sematic is <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>6.2.6.1 Loads and stores of objects with atomic types are done with <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> semantics.</li>
<li>6.5.2.4 (postfix <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>)</li>
<li>6.5.16.2 Compound assignment. No constraints formulated concerning traps for integer types. In contrast to that, no floating exceptions for floating types are allowed. Also, this defines atomic operations for <strong>all</strong> arithmetic operands, including some that don't have library calls (<code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>No such mention is made for</p>
<ul>
<li>6.5.3.1 (prefix <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>), although it explicitly states that these operators are defined to be equivalent to <code>+= 1</code> and <code>-= 1</code>, respectively.</li>
<li>6.5.16.1 Simple assignment, although the paragraph about store says that such a store should be <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>— Integer representations and erroneous operations —</em></p>
<p>Concerning the generic library calls, they state in 7.17.7.5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement
representation with silent wrap-around on overflow; there are no undefined
results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For address types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operations
otherwise have no undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can the sign representation depend on the operation that we apply to an object?<br />
Are these operations supposed to be consistent between operator and function
notation?<br />
What is an <em>address type</em>?<br />
What is "<em>no undefined behavior</em>"? How is the behavior then defined, when we are
not told about it?</p>
<p><em>— Operators versus generic functions —</em></p>
<p>Then a <strong>Note</strong> (7.17.7.5 p 5) states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The operation of the atomic_fetch and modify generic functions are nearly
equivalent to the operation of the corresponding <code>op=</code> compound assignment
operators. The only differences are that the <strong>compound assignment operators are
not guaranteed to operate atomically</strong>, ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there are obviously also operators that act on atomic objects, 5.1.2.4
p 4 gives the completely false impression that atomic operations would only be a
matter of the C library:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The library defines a number of atomic operations (7.17) ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— Pointer types are missing for <code>atomic_fetch_OP</code> —</em></p>
<p>In the general introduction (7.17.1 p4) there is explicitly an extension of the
notations to atomic pointer types:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For atomic pointer types, <code>M</code> is <code>ptrdiff_t</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas the only section where this notation is relevant (7.17.7.5
<code>atomic_fetch_OP</code>) is restricted to <em>atomic integer types</em>, but then later talks
about the result of such operations on <em>address types</em>.</p>
<p><em>— Vocabulary —</em></p>
<p>For the vocabulary, there is a mixture of the use of the verb combinations
between <em>load/store</em>, <em>read/write</em> and <em>fetch/assign</em>. What is the difference?
Is there any?</p>
<p><em>— Over all —</em></p>
<p>This is</p>
<ul>
<li>contradictory (the Note is not normative, but still wrong),</li>
<li>confusing (<code>=</code> is handled different from <code>op=</code>, operators are not mentioned where they should),</li>
<li>weird (the sign representation is described as the result of an operation, not as the value representation of a data type; what is "no undefined behavior" of a address operation?)</li>
<li>inconsistent (operators may result in any sign representation ?, and can trap, generic functions are safe)</li>
<li>incomplete (the set of operators and generic functions are distinct)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Combining all these texts, a number of constraints emerge for arithmetic types
on platforms that support the atomics extension. They would better be stated as
such.</p>
<ol>
<li>Since sign representation is a property of a type and not an operation. To comply to the atomics extension all signed integer types must have two's representation for negative values.</li>
<li>Pointer arithmetic must have a variant that always has defined behavior, only that the stored address may be invalid, if the addition or subtraction passed beyond the boundaries of the object. But that behavior is <strong>not</strong> defined by the standard, the negation of undefined doesn't give a definition.</li>
<li>Binary integer operations <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code> and <code>^</code> must have versions that do not trap.</li>
<li>All floating point operations must have versions that don't raise signals.</li>
</ol>
<p>The distinction in operations on atomics that are realized by operators (all
arithmetic) and only by generic functions is arbitrary. As soon as a type has a
lock-free <code>atomic_compare_exchange</code> operation, all <code>fetch_op</code> or <code>op_fetch</code>
generic functions can be synthesized almost trivially.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are atomic operations on pointer types and floating point types restricted to applying the operator, and don't allow for the generic function?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current practice</strong></p>
<p>Both gcc and clang permit <code>atomic_fetch_add</code> and <code>atomic_fetch_sub</code> on atomic
pointer types.</p>
<p>Both disallow floating point types for the functions but allow them for the
operators.</p>
<p>Gcc extends the infrastructure that it provides of atomics to <code>op_fetch</code> generic
fuctions and adds a new operator <code>nand</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested strategy for improvement</strong></p>
<p>I suggest to first do some minimal changes to the text with a TC to avoid its
contradictions and to centralize its requirements. Then, in a feature request
for a new version of the standard we could discuss to add some more features
that would make the approach internally consistent.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Change the beginning of 5.1.2.4 p5:</p>

mutexes (7.26.4) that are specially identified as synchronization
operations.</del></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><ins>There are a number of operations that are specially identified as
synchronization operations: if the implementation supports the atomics extension
these are operators and generic functions that act on atomic objects (6.5 and
7.17); if the implementation supports the thread extension these are operations
on mutexes (7.26.4).</ins></p>
<p>Replace paragraph 6.2.6.1 p9</p>
<p><del>Loads and stores of objects with atomic types are done with
memory_order_seq_cst semantics.</del></p>
<p>by the following</p>
<p><ins>All operations that act on atomic objects that do not specify otherwise
have <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> memory consistency. If the operation with identical
values on the unqualified type is erroneous it results in an unspecific object
representation, that may or may not be an invalid value for the type, such as an
invalid address or a floating point NaN. Thereby no such operation may by itself
raise a signal, a trap, a floating point exception or result otherwise in an
interruption of the control flow.FOOTNOTE</ins></p>
<p><ins>FOOTNOTE Whether or not an atomic operation may be interrupted by a signal
depends on the lock-free property of the underlying type.</ins></p>
<p>Insert a new paragraph after 6.2.6.2 p2</p>
<p><ins>Implementations that support the atomics extension, represent all signed
integers with two's complement such that the object representation with sign bit
1 and all value bits zero is a normal value.</ins></p>
<p>Insert a new paragraph after 6.5 p3</p>
<p><ins>An operation on an lvalue with an atomic type, that consists of the
evaluation of the object, an optional arithmetic operation and a side effect for
updating the stored value forms a single read-modify-write operation.</ins></p>
<p>Remove the following phrase in 6.5.2.4 p2:</p>
<p><del>Postfix <code>++</code> on an object with atomic type is a read-modify-write operation
with memory_order_seq_cst memory order semantics.</del></p>
<p>Remove the following phrase in 6.5.16.2 p3:</p>
<p><del>If <strong>E1</strong> has an atomic type, compound assignment is a read-modify-write
operation with memory_order_seq_cst memory order semantic</del></p>
<p>Replace 7.17.7 p1</p>
<p><del>There are only a few kinds of operations on atomic types, though there are
many instances of those kinds. This subclause specifies each general kind.</del></p>
<p>by</p>
<p><ins>In addition to the operations on atomic objects that are described by
operators, there are a few kinds of operations that are specified as generic
functions. This subclause specifies each generic function. After evaluation of
its arguments, each of these generic functions forms a single read, write or
read-modify-write operation with same general properties as described in 6.2.6.1
p9.</ins></p>
<p>Assuming that the intent of 7.17.7.5 has been to allow operations on atomic
pointer types, in p1, change:</p>
<p><del>... to an object of any atomic integer type. None of these operations is
applicable to <code>atomic_bool</code></del></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><ins>... to an object of any atomic integer or pointer type, as long as the
unqualified type is valid as left operand of the corresponding operator
<code>op=</code>.FOOTNOTE</p>
<p>FOOTNOTE: Thus these operations are not permitted for pointers to atomic
<code>_Bool</code>, and only "add" and "sub" variants are permitted for atomic pointer
types.</ins></p>
<p>Since this topic is then covered already by a more general section, remove this
sentence from p3:</p>
<p><del>For address types, the result may be an undefined address, but the
operations otherwise have no undefined behavior.</del></p>
<p>In 7.17.7.5 p 5 replace:</p>
<p><del>... the compound assignment operators are not guaranteed to operate
atomically, and ...</del></p>
<p>by</p>
<p><ins>... the <code>order</code> parameter may make the memory consistency less strict than
<code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, and that ...</ins></p>
<p><strong>Future Directions</strong></p>
<p>An editorial revision of the C standard should clarify the vocabulary for the
use of the terms <em>load</em>, <em>store</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>write</em>, <em>modify</em>, <em>fetch</em> and
<em>assign</em>.</p>
<p>A feature revision of the standard should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add generic interfaces for all arithmetic operations. That is, it should add function-like interfaces for the missing operators <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code></li>
<li>Add atomic pointer types (if not by the TC above) and atomic floating point types to the permitted types of the function-like arithmetic operations, such that they are uniformly defined for all types where the corresponding operator applies.</li>
<li>Add generic interfaces <code>atomic_OP_fetch</code> for all <code>atomic_fetch_OP</code>.</li>
<li>Reduce 7.17.6 "Atomic integer types" to just a definition of <code>typedef</code> as indicated in the table.</li>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The committee agrees that there are small inconsistencies remaining in the standard but that they are largely editorial in nature, and yet of potentially of such a sweeping scope that is difficult to assess as a defect. In particular, the various uses of <em>load/store</em>, <em>read/write</em>, and <em>fetch/assign</em> should be clarified and made consistent where possible. It may be advantageous to use ISO standardized vocabulary for this and perhaps other new terms introduced in C11.</li>
<li>Additional related issues were raised in <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13844">(SC22WG14.13844) atomic_fetch and modify generic functions</a>.</li>
<li>The committee does not feel that this DR is “actionable” and should, in this form, result in a Proposed Committee Response. The author is encouraged to extract and provide in a new paper a simpler list of inconsistencies that can be addressed in a DR. The author is also solicited to address the broader issues as a proposal in a new paper for consideration in a new revision of the standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oct 2015 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<p>The proposed changes to §6.2.6.1 paragraph 9 are superfluous and unnecessary.</p>

<h2>Issue 0488: <code>c16rtomb()</code> on wide characters encoded as multiple <code>char16_t</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Philipp Klaus Krause<br />
Date: 2015-12-09<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1991.htm">N1991</a><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Section 7.28.1 describes the function c16rtomb(). In particular, it states "When
c16 is not a valid wide character, an encoding error occurs". "wide character"
is defined in section 3.7.3 as "value representable by an object of type
wchar_t, capable of representing any character in the current locale". This
wording seems to imply that, e.g. for the common cases (e.g, an implementation
that defines __STDC_UTF_16__ and a program that uses an UTF-8 locale),
c16rtomb() will return -1 when it encounters a character that is encoded as
multiple char16_t (for UTF-16 a wide character can be encoded as a surrogate
pair consisting of two char16_t). In particular, c16rtomb() will not be able to
process strings generated by mbrtoc16().</p>
<p>I would like to implement a standard-conforming c16rtomb() for SDCC, that allows
conversion from all of UTF-16 (not just the basic multilingual plane) to UTF-8.
It seems to me that this is currently not possible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the description of mbrtoc16() described in section 7.28.1
states "If the function determines that the next multibyte character is complete
and valid, it determines the values of the corresponding wide characters". So it
considers it possible that a single multibyte character translates into multiple
wide characters. So maybe the meaning of "wide character" in section 7.28.1 is
different from definition of "wide character" in section 3.7.3.</p>
<p>In either case, the intended behaviour of c16rtomb() for characters encoded as
multiple char16_t seems unclear. The issue has been discussed in the thread "A
function to convert char16_t strings to char strings" in comp.std.c.</p>
<h3>Suggested Change</h3>
<p>I see two possible options:</p>
<ul>
<li>State clearly that passing a char16_t that is not a valid character by itself to c16rtomb() is an error. In this case, another function to convert char16_t strings to char strings should be provided by the standard. The term "wide character" should then not be used in the description of mbrtoc16() the way it currently is.</li>
<li>State clearly that c16rtomb() can handle characters consisting of multiple char16_t. For such characters the first call would return 0, and only once all char16_t encoding the character had been seen, c16rtomb() could write the character as multibyte character. The current wording "When c16 is not a valid wide character, an encoding error occurs" should be changed accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In an integer constant expression (ICE) in 6.6p6, if an operand is NOT
evaluated, must it follow the constraints and semantics of 6.6?</p>
<p>WG14 messages 14092 to 14102 (with subject of: Fixed size array or VLA?) discuss
this issue.</p>
<p>Places where expressions are not evaluated:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0 &amp;&amp; funny</code></li>
<li><code>1 || funny</code></li>
<li><code>0 ? funny : other</code></li>
<li><code>1 ? other : funny</code></li>
<li><code>_Generic(funny,...)</code></li>
<li><code>sizeof(funny)</code></li>
<li><code>_Alignof(funny)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of 'funny' code (that are allowed in expressions that are not
evaluated):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assignment = operator</code></li>
<li><code>inc++ and ++inc</code></li>
<li><code>dec-- and --dec</code></li>
<li><code>func_call()</code></li>
<li><code>(comma,operator)</code></li>
<li><code>3.0</code></li>
<li><code>0/0</code></li>
<li><code>1.0/0.0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Places where ICEs are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>size of bit-fields, eg, <code>struct s1{ int bit : ICE; }s2;</code></li>
<li>enum constant, eg, <code>enum e1{a=ICE}e2;</code></li>
<li>size of non-VLA arrays, eg, <code>static int ary[ICE];</code></li>
<li>conditional inclusion, eg, <code>#if ICE</code></li>
<li>null pointer constant, eg, <code>#define NULL ICE</code></li>
<li>alignment specifier, eg, <code>_Alignas(ICE)</code></li>
<li>initialization, eg, <code>{[ICE] = value}</code></li>
<li>static assertions, eg, <code>_Static_assert(ICE,"string");</code></li>
<li><strong>case</strong> labels, eg, <code>case ICE:</code></li>
<li>some object-like macros, eg, <code>#define EDOM ICE</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Several people expressed an opinion that just parsing the expression (syntax)
without depending upon any values (semantics) is a good thing. However,
<strong>sizeof</strong>(var) depends upon var being a fixed size array versus VLA to
determine if it is a valid ICE. So, some semantic checking must be done.</p>
<p>Some parts of the C standard that might help answer the question follow.</p>
<p>Footnote 118 in 6.6p11 shows the use of 'funny' code:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">static</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>i<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">2</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">||</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">1</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">/</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span>;

</blockquote>
<p>6.6p2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A constant expression can be evaluated during translation rather than runtime,
and accordingly may be used in any place that a constant may be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.4.6p2 has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An operand is an entity on which an operator acts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to me that if an operand is not evaluated, then nothing is being acted
upon, so is not an operand.</p>
<p>By 6.6p10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An implementation may accept other forms of constant expressions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>any implementation may accept these unevaluated expressions; but that does not
mean that all implementations must accept them. And, by the committee discussion
in DR 312 against C99, these "other forms" cannot be an ICE (those words are not
in C99 or C11).</p>
<p>3.1 <strong>access</strong> note 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expressions that are not evaluated do not access objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add (something along the lines of) either</p>
<ul>
<li>(that are evaluated)</li>
<li>(even if not evaluated)</li>
</ul>
<p>after "operands" in the first line of 6.6p6 and second line in 6.6p8.</p>
<p>Perhaps, add a footnote giving an example to the phrase being added.</p>
<p>Add to the end of 6.6p10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>however, they are not integer constant expressions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, update J.2 items on ICE and arithmetic constant expression.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In trying to determine if exp(infinity) is a range error, I have come across an
unwritten assumption (held by many members of the committee) with respect to:
"if &lt;violation&gt; then &lt;consequence&gt;". WG14 email messages 13920 to 13937
(with subject of: Meaning of IF-THEN) have a discussion of this.</p>
<p>Message 13925 has in part: That these "if-then" statements were meant to follow
the ordinary-language model, where "if &lt;violation&gt; then &lt;consequence&gt;"
promises that &lt;violation&gt; would necessarily lead to &lt;consequence&gt;, but
nothing more. That is similar to the Boolean model. But that has to be combined
with a general rule that when the C standard doesn't mention &lt;consequence&gt; as
a visible action in some well-defined circumstance, then it is guaranteed that
it does not occur.</p>
<p>Message 13925 also has: There is a related issue: Just because some defined
behavior is allowed to fail, it was not intended that it could always fail.</p>
<p>Message 13937 has in part: In general, when the C standard doesn't say that
something specific is supposed to happen, it intended that nothing happens.
Explicit permission is given for errno to be set under certain circumstances</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Add to 4.0 Conformance after paragraph 1, words along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless stated otherwise (<strong>errno</strong> is one such otherwise), when the C standard
doesn't say that something specific is supposed to happen, it is intended that
nothing happens. Also, just because some defined behavior is allowed to fail, it

<h2>Issue 0491: Concern with Keywords that Match Reserved Identifiers</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Should a conforming program be allowed to use identifiers spelled with a leading
underscore followed by an uppercase letter that match the spelling of a keyword?</p>
<p>The C committee has been adding keywords to the C standard spelled with a
leading underscore followed by an uppercase letter so that they will not
conflict with identifiers that are not already reserved to the implementation,
i.e. so existing programs that conform to the C standard are not impacted by
addition of new keywords in a new revision of the C standard.</p>
<p>So the C standard spells keywords in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading underscore followed by an uppercase letter</li>
<li>Leading lowercase letter</li>
</ul>
<p>7.1.2p4 provides restrictions on when macros with names lexically identical to
keywords can be defined, thus infering when macro names lexically identical to
keywords can be defined.</p>
<p>As specified in 7.1.3, identifiers spelled with a leading underscore followed by
an uppercase letter are reserved to the implementation.  While those identifiers
beginning with a lowercase letter are not.  Thus, for example, a conforming
program can use <code>inline</code> as a macro name, but a conforming program cannot use
<code>_Noreturn</code> as a macro name.</p>
<p>Though the C committee has added new keywords from the reserved identifier
namespace, the committee has not updated the rules about reserved identifiers. 
What I don't know is if that is intentional or an oversight, as I don't ever
remember discussing the issue from that perspective during a committee meeting.</p>
<p>The issue came to my attention when I found some C standard headers defining
_<code>Noreturn</code> as a macro because they knew it is an identifier reserved to the
implementation.  I was a bit surprised, as it required a otherwise conforming
program to <code>#undef _Noreturn</code> in order to use the _<code>Noreturn</code> keyword as a
function specifier.  The macro in this case was expanding to a gcc like
attribute syntax recognized by the compiler.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>Replace the first two bullets under 7.1.3p1 with:</p>
<p>— All identifiers that begin with an underscore and either an uppercase letter
or another underscore are always reserved for any use<ins>, except those
identifiers which are lexically identical to keywords</ins>.
<ins><sup>footnote)</sup></ins><br />
— All identifiers that begin with an underscore are always reserved for use as
identifiers with file scope in both the ordinary and tag name spaces<ins>,

followed by an uppercase letter that match the spelling of a keyword to be used

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Some weeks ago I posted the following code to the reflector after an argument at
work as to whether it was legal, and if so, what was it meant to do?</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">       </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">S1</span>

<span style="color: #bbbbbb">                    </span>{<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span>m11;
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">                     </span><span style="color: #B00040">float</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span>m12;
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">                    </span>};

<span style="color: #bbbbbb">               </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>m13;
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">            </span>}<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>s1;
</pre></div>

<p>The issue is that U11 isn't an anonymous union (because it has a name U11) but
doesn't declare a member of S1. When tried with a number of compilers the result
was either that it was rejected as a constraint error or it was treated as an
anonymous union, with m11 and m12 accessible as though they were members of S1
(e.g. s1.m11 = 42;). The declaration of union U11 was also added at file scope,
so could be used in other structs.</p>
<p>After some discussion (thanks to Doug and Roberto), it was concluded that the
code was intended to be a constraint error because it can be argued that it
violates the first constraint in 6.7.2.1 para 2 "A <em>struct-declaration</em> that
does not declare an anonymous structure or anonymous union shall contain a
<em>struct-declarator-list</em>". The syntax fragment its referring to is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>struct-declaration:<br />
specifier-qualifier-list struct-declarator-list<sub>opt</sub></em> <code>;</code><br />
<em>static_assert-declaration</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In parsing the above code “<code>union U11 {int m11; float m12;} ;</code>” is a
<em>struct-declaration</em>. It is believed that the intended reading is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>“<code>union U11 {int m11; float m12;}</code>” is a <em>specifier-qualifier-list</em></li>
<li>There is no <em>struct-declarator-list</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, as U11 isn't an anonymous union and doesn't have a
<em>struct-declarator-list</em>, it violates the quoted constraint.</p>
<p>However, there would appear to be a different reading that says that this
<em>struct-declaration</em> does “contain a <em>struct-declarator-list</em>”. So it shouldn't
be a constraint error hence the potential need for a DR to clarify the intent
(discussed in the next section).</p>
<p>The alternative reading of the constraint requirement comes about because the
<em>specifier-qualifier-list</em> <code>union U11 {int m11; float m12;}</code> is interpreted by
recursively entering the same part of the syntax tree. As its interpreted, int
m11; and float m12; are <em>struct-declarations</em>, where “m11” and “m12” are
<em>struct-declarator-lists,</em>. So the <em>struct-declaration</em> for U11 does contain a
<em>struct-declarator-lists</em>, so shouldn't be a constraint error.</p>
<p>The response to that argument on the reflector was that ‘whenever a constraint
refers to elements of the syntax tree, it means those elements in the term
currently being processed, and not any terms that may be found by recursively
traversing the tree’. However, I cannot see this principle stated anywhere in
the standard.</p>
<p>Hence, I'd argue that whether this code is legal or not is ambiguous and a DR is
required, either to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Establish the principle that “whenever a constraint refers to elements of the syntax tree, it means those elements in the term currently being processed, and not any terms that maybe found by recursively traversing the tree”, or</li>
<li>Reword the constraint in 6.7.2.1 para 2 to clarify that the above code is intended to be aconstraint error, for example by adding ‘shall contain a struct-declarator-list, <ins>other than any that may be found in the interpretation of the <em>specifier-qualifier-list</em></ins>’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The C11 threads library defines a mutex type, <code>mtx_t</code>, and a number of functions
that operate objects of the type. The <code>mtx_t</code> is fully described in <strong>§7.26.1,
Introduction</strong> (to the <strong>Threads</strong> section) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a complete object type that holds an identifier for a mutex;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other description of the type appears elsewhere in the text.</p>
<p>Among the functions provided by the C11 threads library that operate on objects
of the <code>mtx_t</code> type are <code>mtx_init()</code> and <code>mtx_destroy()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>mtx_init(mtx_t *mtx, int type)</code> function is described in <strong>§7.26.4.2</strong> as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-2- The <code>mtx_init</code> function creates a mutex object with properties indicated by
<code>type</code>, which must have one of the six values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mtx_plain</code> for a simple non-recursive mutex,</li>
<li><code>mtx_timed</code> for a non-recursive mutex that supports timeout,</li>
<li><code>mtx_plain | mtx_recursive</code> for a simple recursive mutex, or</li>
<li><code>mtx_timed | mtx_recursive</code> for a recursive mutex that supports timeout.</li>
</ul>
<p>-3- If the <code>mtx_init</code> function succeeds, it sets the mutex pointed to by <code>mtx</code>
to a value that uniquely identifies the newly created mutex.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong><br />
-4- The mtx_init function returns <code>thrd_success</code> on success, or <code>thrd_error</code> if
the request could not be honored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>mtx_destroy(mtx_t *mtx)</code> function is then described in <strong>§7.26.4.1</strong> like
so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>mtx_destroy</code> function releases any resources used by the mutex pointed to
by <code>mtx</code>. No threads can be blocked waiting for the mutex pointed to by <code>mtx</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Problems With <code>mtx_t</code></h4>
<p>Since <code>mtx_t</code> is a complete object type, what are the semantics of copying
objects of the type (either by assignment or by passing them by value between
functions) and passing pointers to distinct copies of the same mutex object as
arguments to the C11 threads functions?</p>
<h4>Problems With <code>mtx_init()</code></h4>
<p>The specification of <code>mtx_init()</code> raises the following questions to which the
standard doesn't provide clear answers.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the behavior of <code>mtx_init()</code> when called with a pointer to an object initialized to all zeros (such as a mutex object with static storage duration)? Are such calls valid, or if not, must the function fail by returning <code>thrd_error</code>, or is its behavior unspecified, or perhaps undefined? (If it is the same as calling it on an uninitialized object then how does one statically initialize a mutex?)</li>
<li>Similarly, what is the function's behavior when called with a pointer to an uninitialized mutex object (one whose value is indeterminate)? (Presumably, it should be to initialize the object to a valid state and not require the object to have been initialized to all zeros, but this is not specified.)</li>
<li>What is the function's behavior when called with the same pointer more than once (without a call to <code>mtx_destroy()</code> in between)?</li>
<li>What is the function's behavior when called with a pointer to a locked mutex object?</li>
<li>The function description specifies that the <code>type</code> argument must have one of six values but lists only four. What are the remaining two values of the <code>type</code> argument? (Note: this problem is the subject of DR <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0479">479</a>.)</li>
<li>What is the function's behavior when <code>type</code> argument does not have one of the listed values? (Note that since the argument is a plain <code>int</code>, choosing not to define the behavior will make the function more dangerous to use than alternatives such as POSIX threads. Choosing to require the function to detect invalid arguments and reject them with an error exposes a problem due to its binary return value's inability to indicate different kinds of errors.)</li>
<li>If the function is required to fail when the <code>type</code> argument isn't valid, what is its required behavior in this case when the <code>mtx</code> argument is null?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Problems With <code>mtx_destroy()</code></h4>
<p>The specification of <code>mtx_destroy()</code> raises the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the behavior of <code>mtx_destroy()</code> when called with a pointer to an object initialized to all zeros (such as a mutex object with static storage duration) that has not been passed to <code>mtx_init()</code>? (This is important because it might mean that programs need to associate an external flag with each mutex object indicating whether or not it has been initialized in a way that requires <code>mtx_destroy()</code> to be called on it.)</li>
<li>What is the behavior of the function when called with the same pointer more than once? Is it required to have no effect or is it undefined?</li>
<li>What is the behavior of the function when threads are blocked waiting for the mutex it's called on? (The text is lax with the wording here, and assuming the function's behavior is undefined in this case, the text should phrase the requirement using the word "<em>shall</em>" rather than "<em>can</em>" and preferably make the undefined behavior explicit, for example similarly to how POSIX specifies the similar requirement in its API.)</li>
<li>What state is a mutex object in after <code>mtx_destroy()</code> has been called with it as an argument? Can such an object be subsequently passed as argument to any of the other mutex functions? For example, can such a mutex object be safely passed to <code>mtx_init()</code>? To any of the other mutex functions such as <code>mtx_lock()</code> and, if so, with what effects? (Undefined or error?)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Other Problems Due to the Underspecification Of Mutex Initialization</h4>
<p>Neither <code>mtx_init()</code> nor <code>mtx_destroy()</code> discussed above, nor any of the other
functions that operate on <code>mtx_t</code> objects specifies what state the object is
required to be in when the function is called. In particular, none of the
functions specfies whether the object is required to be initialized or how.</p>
<p>That gives rise to the following general questions to which the standard fails
to provide clear answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is an uninitialized mutex object (i.e., one with an indeterminate value) a valid argument to any of the other mutex functions besides those discussed above? If it isn't a valid argument (as is the most likely answer), are the mutex functions expected to detect the condition and fail by returning <code>thrd_error</code> or is the behavior unspecified, or perhaps undefined?</li>
<li>Similarly, is a statically initialized mutex object (one declared with static storage duration and initialized to all zeros) a valid argument to any of the the other mutex functions? For instance, is such a mutex a valid argument to <code>mtx_lock()</code> and if so, what is the "type" of such a mutex (is it plain, recurisive, or timed), and what state is it in? (Put another way, what are the effects of calling <code>mtx_lock()</code> on such a mutex?)</li>
<li>Assuming a statically initialized mutex object is a valid argument to only <code>mtx_init()</code> but not any of the mutex functions, what mechanism are C11 programs expected to use to statically initialize mutex objects to make them valid arguments to functions such as <code>mtx_lock()</code> (the equivalent of the POSIX threads <code>PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER</code>)? Note that while some systems do not provide an API to statically initialize a native mutex object the functionality can be emulated by storing a flag in the C11 <code>mtx_t</code> object and checking that flag in every mutex function, lazily initializing the object as necessary. It is unclear whether C11 intends to require implementations to provide this functionality.</li>
<li>Is there any limit on the the number of times <code>mtx_init()</code> cam be called with a distinct object as an argument without an intervening call to <code>mtx_destroy()</code>? (In other words, must calls to <code>mtx_init()</code> and <code>mtx_destroy()</code> with the same mutex object be paired?) If it is intended to allow implementations to impose such a limit (as some do) how do programs distinguish the usually transient nature of exceeding such a limit from permanent mutex initialization errorss (such as invalid type arguments)?</li>
</ol>
<p>One might be able to guess what some of the answers to the questions above might
be intended to be if one assumes that the library is meant to be implemented on
top of an existing threads library such as POSIX threads, but that is not
reflected in the specification in any way. Other reasonable guesses include that
C11 threads library is intended to provide a simpler though no less safe
interface to the underlying threads library on the system (i.e., with no
instances of undefined behavior the underlying threads library isn't already
subject to), but the lack of even the most basic requirements raises doubt about
this intent. Another possible guess is that the C11 threads library is intended
to be (or should be possible to be) independent of the underlying threads
implementation and provide its own distinct guarantees and impose its own
requirements (even though it in many cases fails to articulate them). In the
absence of answers to these questions the C11 threads library is essentially
unusable as a specification either for the development of implementations
facilitating portable code, or for writing portable code.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The C11 threads specification should be amended to clearly answer the questions
above. Any new requirements should consider the goal of implementing the
specification in terms of an existings threads implementation such as the POSIX
threads library.</p>

<p>This document asks quite a number of questions, and they are answered according

<p><strong>Problems with <code>mtx_t</code></strong></p>
<p>The semantics of copying a <code>mtx_t</code> are not specified, much like <code>FILE</code>
§7.21.3p6.</p>
<p><strong>Problems with <code>mtx_init()</code></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><code>mtx_init</code> will attempt to initialize whatever memory is referenced by the pointer passed in, so it will initialize static memory preset to zero. Such calls are valid.</li>
<li><code>mtx_init</code> will attempt to initialize whatever memory is referenced by the pointer passed in, so it will initialize memory that has previously been used as a <code>mtx_t</code>.</li>
<li>It is undefined behavior to call <code>mtx_init()</code> on memory without an intervening <code>mtx_destroy</code>.</li>
<li>It is undefined behavior to call <code>mtx_init()</code> on memory without an intervening <code>mtx_destroy</code> regardless of the lock condition.</li>
<li>See <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0414">DR 414</a> for the resolution to the miscounted variations of <code>mtx_init()</code> options.</li>
<li>Undefined behavior is the result of passing values other than those specified in the standard. The wording in the Standard shall change from ‘must’ to ‘shall’ in §7.26.4.2p2.</li>
<li>The value returned by <code>mtx_init()</code> when passed a NULL pointer shall be unspecified.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Problems with <code>mtx_destroy()</code></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is undefined behavior to call <code>mtx_destroy()</code> with a pointer to an object that has not been initialized by a call to <code>mtx_init()</code>. In §7.26.4.1p2 the editor should consider changing ‘can’ to ‘shall’.</li>
<li>It is undefined behavior to call <code>mtx_destroy()</code> with a pointer to an object that has not been initialized by a call to <code>mtx_init()</code>, so calling it twice without an intervening <code>mtx_init</code> results in undefined behavior.</li>
<li>Calling <code>mtx_destroy()</code> while it is locked is intended to be undefined and will be resolved by <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0469">DR 469</a>.</li>
<li>The memory that had been used as an <code>mtx_t</code> object has indeterminate value. Undefined behavior results if it is subsequently used as an argument to other <code>mtx</code> functions other than <code>mtx_init</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Problems</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Memory with indeterminate value is appropriate to be used only with <code>mtx_init</code> as described above. All other uses result in undefined behavior.</li>
<li>Static memory preset to zeros is appropriate to be used only with <code>mtx_init</code> as described above. All other uses result in undefined behavior.</li>
<li>The C Standard provides no mechanism to statically initialize a <code>mtx_t</code>.</li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Point D of DR439 (a.k.a. N1729) raises the question of the meaning of a
non-constant expression in an abstract declarator. The other points of that DR
are rather more straightforward, but point D requires more thought. Here I
present some additional analysis I have done on the question.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There are three places an abstract declarator or type name can appear and (at
least potentially) not be part of a larger expression:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>parameter-declaration</em></li>
<li><em>alignment-specifier</em></li>
<li><em>atomic-type-specifier</em></li>
</ol>
<p>(When this topic comes up, the case of a generic selection is generally raised
as well. However, it should be clearly understood that a type name appearing in
a generic selection is necessarily part of a larger expression, so any
expression therein isn't a full expression, so DR439 does not raise any issues
about it. It's certainly possible that there are issues, but if so, they need to
be spelled out. Once they have been clearly defined, it will hopefully become
clear whether they should be considered along with DR439 or separately.)</p>
<p>So let's consider three file-scope declarations:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>void f(int [rand()]);</code></li>
<li><code>_Alignas(int [rand()]) int i;</code></li>
<li><code>_Atomic(int [rand()]) a;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The first declaration has a clearly defined meaning. According to 6.7.6.2p5, the
expression is “treated as if it were replaced by <code>*</code>”. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>the expression is not evaluated; and</li>
<li>the parameter is declared as a VLA of unspecified size.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are both true even if the declaration appears in a block scope.</p>
<p>For the second and third declarations, the standard today gives no clue how the
expression should be handled. The only thing that is clear (even though the
standard doesn't say so) is that, if the declarations are at file scope, any
answer that requires evaluating the expressions is wrong.</p>
<h3>The alignment specifier case</h3>
<p>The interesting thing about <code>_Alignas</code> is that the “answer” is just a number;
all other details of the type named are irrelevant. Since the alignment of an
array type must be the same as that of its element type, the value of the array
size is irrelevant, so strictly speaking it need not be evaluated.</p>
<p>This is similar to <code>sizeof</code>; according to 6.7.6.2p5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where a size expression is part of the operand of a <code>sizeof</code> operator and
changing the value of the size expression would not affect the result of the
operator, it is unspecified whether or not the size expression is evaluated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an alignment specifier, I would prefer that the behavior not depend on the
scope in which it appears. It would also be simpler to require that a
non-constant size expression <strong>not</strong> be evaluated than to permit implementation
latitude. That would be consistent with the parameter declaration case, and I
doubt that any real-world code would change behavior as a result.</p>
<p>As an aside, here is an interesting related example:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">size_t</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>s<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>[rand()]);
</pre></div>

<p>According to 6.5.3.4p2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the type of the operand is a variable length array type, the operand is
evaluated; otherwise, the operand is not evaluated and the result is an integer
constant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the declaration of <code>s</code> appeared at file scope, the fact that the result of
<code>sizeof</code> is not an integer constant would run afoul of the constraints on
initialization, so a diagnostic would be required. That might be considered
enough to override the requirement that “the operand is evaluated” in an
initializer at file scope – but the phrasing would seem to be suboptimal.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>void f(int [rand()]);</code></li>
<li><code>_Alignas(int [rand()]) int i;</code></li>
<li><code>_Atomic(int [rand()]) a;</code></li>
</ol>

expression should be handled. The only thing that is clear (even though the
standard doesn't say so) is that, if the declarations are at file scope, any
answer that requires evaluating the expressions is wrong.</p>
<h3>The atomic type specifier case</h3>
<p><code>_Atomic</code>-of-array types are already disallowed; see 6.7.2.4p3. The following
example avoids that restriction, but still has a non-constant expression in an
atomic specifier:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">_Atomic</span>(<span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #666666">*</span>)[rand()])<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>p1;
</pre></div>

<p>What would such a declaration mean, if it were allowed?</p>
<p>It would be tempting to conclude that it is not allowed at file scope, since a
variably modified type is involved. Unfortunately, the standard doesn't actually
say so – or at least not yet. According to 6.7.6p3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, any type derived by declarator type derivation from a variably
modified type is itself variably modified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But an atomic type specifier isn't described as involving declarator type
derivation. There is definitely a kind of type derivation involved, but possibly
of a new and different kind.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because of the unique dual nature of the syntax for
<code>_Atomic</code>, the preferred answer is probably that the previous declaration would
have the same meaning as this declaration:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #666666">*</span><span style="color: #B00040">_Atomic</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>p2)[rand()];
</pre></div>

<p>If a qualifier other than <code>_Atomic</code> were used, the interpretation of the
declaration and the contained expression would be pretty clear from the
standard. But for <code>_Atomic</code>, the words of the standard seem to more or less
rewrite this declaration into the prior form, about which the standard has less
to say, by and large.</p>
<p>If it is true, as seems likely, that any atomic type specifier containing a
non-constant expression can be expressed equivalently using an atomic type
qualifier instead, then presumably the question of what to do when the
expression is syntactically a full expression is not all that interesting.</p>
<p>What remains interesting is how to express this intention normatively.</p>

<h2>Issue 0496: <code>offsetof</code> questions</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Martin Sebor<br />
Date: 2016-03-23<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <code>offsetof</code> macro is specified in the normative text of the C11 standard in
<strong>§7.19 Common Definitions <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code></strong> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The macros [defined in the header <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code>] are...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>offsetof(</code><em>type</em><code>,</code> <em>member-designator</em><code>)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which expands to an integer constant expression that has type <code>size_t</code>, the
value of which is the offset in bytes, to the structure member (designated by
<em>member-designator</em>), from the beginning of its structure (designated by
<em>type</em>). The type and member designator shall be such that given</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">static</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>type<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>t;
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>then the expression <code>&amp;(t.</code><em>member-designator</em><code>)</code> evaluates to an address
constant. (If the specified member is a bit-field, the behavior is undefined.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, undefined uses of the macro are mentioned in the informative <strong>§J.2
Undefined Behavior</strong> using the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— The member designator parameter of an <code>offsetof</code> macro is an invalid right
operand of the <code>.</code> operator for the type parameter, or designates a bit-field
(7.19).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A number of questions have been independently raised about this specification
over the years, both by C (and C++) committee members and by implementers of
both languages (the C++ defintion of the macro is largely equivalent to C's),
pointing out gaps or aspects lacking in clarity. Most recently some of the
questions were raised in the thread <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13852">(SC22WG14.13852) what's a
member-designator?</a> As a result
of the lack of clarity, implementations diverge in what <code>offsetof</code> expressions
they accept. In one case, an implementer of a compiler known for its conformance
and high quality of diagnostics interpreted the specification as restricting the
<code>member-designator</code> operand of the macro to ordinary identifiers and to the
exclusion of references to subobjects.</p>
<p>For example, given the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">A</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>n,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>a<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>[<span style="color: #666666">2</span>];<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>};

<p>Some of the questions that have been identified are outlined in the following
list.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the specification, the <em>member-designator</em> operand is referred to as a
<em>structure member</em>. Is this intended to include members of subobjects (members
of structures other thant <em>type</em>, subobjects of which are members of <em>type</em>), or
of and array elements as in the code examples above, or are the diagnostics
required?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>type</em> operand is described as designating a structure. Is a <em>type</em> that
that refers to a union not a valid operand? (No implementation has been observed
to reject union operands.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does C intend to permit defining a new type as the <em>type</em> operand? For example,
is the following a well-formed expression? (No implementation has been observed
to reject such operands.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>offsetof<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>(<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">A</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>i;<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>},<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>i)
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>If C does intend to permit defining a new type in <code>offsetof</code> expressions, does
it intend to permit defining arbitrarily complex types such as the one below?
(No implementation is known to accept the definition of a type containing commas
since they are interpreted by the preprocessor as separating macro arguments.
But since implementations often define the <code>offsetof</code> macro in terms of a
built-in function, it would be possible to implement each as a variadic macro
and function, respectively, and handle this corner case. This isn't a question
about whether it would be worthwhile to do so but rather about whether the
standard text can be interpreted so as to require implementers to accept this
admittedly unusual case.)</p>

<p>Some of the same questions and others were summarized a number of years ago by
Joseph Myers in his paper on

Joseph chose not to submit the paper to WG14 we believe many are still relevant

a paper that consolidates existing practice since this seems to be a nearly
universal extension.</p>

<h2>Issue 0497: "white-space character" defined in two places</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Fred J. Tydeman<br />
Date: 2016-03-24<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>"white-space character" is defined differently in two places in the standard.</p>
<p>white-space character is defined in 6.4 as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>space, horizontal tab, new-line, vertical tab, form-feed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>standard white-space character is defined in 7.4.1.10 for <strong>isspace()</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>space, horizontal tab, new-line, vertical tab, form-feed, carriage return</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One place it matters is 7.21.6.2 fscanf().</p>
<p>7.21.6.2 fscanf() in paragraph 5 talks about white-space character(s) in the
directive. Since there is no reference to <strong>isspace</strong>, it must be referring to
6.4 (which I believe is wrong).</p>
<p>Paragraph 8, in the same section, talks about input white-space characters, but
refers to <strong>isspace</strong>.</p>
<p>In the following code, the \r (carriage return) is a directive:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #9C6500">#include</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span>printf(<span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;rc=%i, cnt1=%i, i=%i, cnt2=%i</span><span style="color: #AA5D1F; font-weight: bold">\n</span><span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;</span>,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>rc,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>cnt1,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>i,<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>cnt2);
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">  </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">0</span>;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Is the \r a white-space character or an ordinary multibyte character?</p>
<p>By 5.2.1#3, the \r is part of the basic execution character set, but is not
part of the basic source character set (as Doug Gwyn pointed out in message
14152).</p>
<p>By 6.4#3, the \r is not a white-space character.</p>
<p>By 7.21.6.2#3, #5 and #6, since the \r is not a white-space character, it is an
ordinary multibyte character. Therefore, since the \r does not match the
characters of the stream, cnt1, i, and cnt2 are not altered. However, this not
what most implementations do. They output: rc=1, cnt1=1, i=123, cnt2=4</p>
<p>I see a mismatch between what implementations are doing and what the standard
requires.</p>
<p>Another issue is "white space" in 7.21.6.2#15. It should be "white-space
characters". Section 6.4 defines "white space" as both comments and white-space
characters. So, the use of "white space" in 7.21.6.2#15 would cause /* comments
*/ to be matched. The same issue applies to 7.29.2.2#15, 7.29.4.1.2#4,
7.22.1.4#4.</p>
<p>Another issue is "white-space wide character" is not well defined (in
7.30.2.1.10) and is missing from the index. Does the "C" locale matter?</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>There are several ways this basic issue can be addressed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add 'carriage return' to the definition of white-space in 6.4. However, this only makes 6.4 and <strong>isspace</strong> match for the "C" locale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add '(as specified by the <strong>isspace</strong> function)' to 'white-space characters' throughout clause 7 of the standard. Add '(as specified by the <strong>iswspace</strong> function)' to 'white-space wide characters' throughout clause 7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout clauses 5 and 6 (except for 5.1.1.2#7 which is execution), change 'white-space characters' to 'source white-space characters'. There might be an issue with 'non-white-space character' being changed to 'non-source-white-space character'.</p>
<p>In clause 7.1.1, add definitions of 'execution white-space character' and
'execution white-space wide character'. Change 'white-space character' to
'execution white-space character' throughout clause 7. Change 'white-space wide
character' to 'execution white-space wide character' throughout clause 7.</p>
<p>Throughout clause 7, remove '(as specified by the <strong>isspace</strong> function)' and
'(as specified by the <strong>iswspace</strong> function)'.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2>Issue 0498: <code>mblen</code>, <code>mbtowc</code>, and <code>wctomb</code> thread-safety</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This corresponds to Austin Group Defect #708 by Rich Felker. The following four
paragraphs are copies of that Defect Report and the three responses, all from
2013.</p>
<p>dalias (Rich Felker, musl libc): Per C11 7.1.4 paragraph 5, "Unless explicitly
stated otherwise in the detailed descriptions that follow, library functions
shall prevent data races as follows: A library function shall not directly or
indirectly access objects accessible by threads other than the current thread
unless the objects are accessed directly or indirectly via the function's
arguments. A library function shall not directly or indirectly modify objects
accessible by threads other than the current thread unless the objects are
accessed directly or indirectly via the function's non-const arguments.
Implementations may share their own internal objects between threads if the
objects are not visible to users and are protected against data races." 7.22.7
(Multibyte/wide character conversion functions) does not specify that these
functions are not required to avoid data races with other calls. The only time
they would even potentially be subject to data races is for state-dependent
encodings, which are all but obsolete; for single-byte or modern multi-byte
(i.e. UTF-8) encodings, these functions are pure. Note that 7.29.6.3
(Restartable multibyte/wide character conversion functions) does make exceptions
that the "r" versions of these functions are not required to avoid data races
when the state argument is NULL.</p>
<p>geoffclare: It seems odd that C11 would have different thread-safety
requirements for mbrlen, mbrtowc, and wcrtomb with a null state argument than
for mblen, mbtowc, and wctomb. We should query this with the C committee, as it
may well be unintentional.</p>
<p>dalias: I think there's a very good reason for the discrepancy: the restartable
versions can store a partially-decoded character in the mbstate_t object, so
even for state-independent encodings, there is state which would need to be
protected against data races. The non-restartable versions, on the other hand,
are pure except in the case of state-dependent encodings, which are mostly a
relic of the past and which were never supported on most POSIX systems, since
these encodings are mostly incompatible with POSIX filesystem semantics. Only
implementations supporting such encodings (which might not even exist - can
anyone confirm?) would incur the burden of avoiding data races. Note that these
functions give applications access to information on whether the locale's
encoding is state-dependent, so a portable application could use the restartable
interfaces when the locale is state-dependent, and the non-restartable ones
otherwise. As to the motivation behind my request for this change, I have spent
a good deal of time investigating the performance bottlenecks in
character-at-a-time multibyte processing, and it turns out that there is a
fundamental bottleneck in the restartable interfaces due to their interface
requirements for handling the ps argument and partially-decoded characters. For
applications which don't need partial-character processing capability, I believe
it would make sense to encourage a transition to the non-restartable interfaces,
but of course this is problematic if the non-restartable interfaces are not
thread-safe. In my experiments, I found the non-restartable interfaces capable
of reaching roughly a 50% performance advantage over the restartable ones; this
difference would of course become even more extreme if the core decoding
algorithms were further optimized.</p>
<p>nick: This will be raised as a potential defect with the C committee, and any
decision on how to proceed should be made there first.</p>
<p>It seems however that this was so far not brought to the attention of WG 14.
There seems to be confusion about the thread-safety of mblen(), mbtowc() and
wctomb() when the encoding is not state-dependent. While the C standard seems to
imply that the functions are thread-safe when the encoding is not
state-dependent, apparently some think otherwise. The GNU/Linux manpage for
these functions states "MT-Unsafe race", and recommends to use mbrlen() instead.
Thus clarification is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Change</strong></p>
<p>A footnote could be added to 7.22.7 clarifying that the functions mblen(),
mbtowc() and wctomb() do not keep internal state if the encoding is not
state-dependent.</p>

<p>Comment from WG14 on 2018-10-18:</p>
<p>Oct 2016 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The text in §7.1.4 paragraph 5 requires implementations to avoid data races in
library functions that maintain their internal state. The <code>mblen</code>, <code>mbtowc</code>, and
<code>wctomb</code> functions are among those that maintain such state. Although the state
is typically needed only for state-dependent, multibyte encodings, the standard
doesn't intend to prevent implementations from accessing it for other encodings
as well. And indeed implementations are known to exist that access the state for
other encodings as well. Multi-threaded programs that need the functionality
provided by these functions are intended to make use of the corresponding
restartable forms of these functions instead (i.e., <code>mbrlen</code>, <code>mbrtowc</code>, and
<code>wcrtomb</code>, respectively) with a non-null state pointer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §7.22.7 paragraph 1 , change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changing the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> category causes the conversion state of these functions
to be indeterminate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changing the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> category causes the conversion state of these functions
to be indeterminate. A call to any one of these functions may introduce a data
race with a call to any other function in this section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In §7.29.6.3 paragraph 1 , change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The implementation behaves as if no library function calls these functions with
a null pointer for <code>ps</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The implementation behaves as if no library function calls these functions with
a null pointer for <code>ps</code>. A call to one of these functions with a null <code>ps</code>
pointer may introduce a data race with another call to the same function.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Oct 2018 meeting</p>
<h3>Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The "C17" edition of the standard has been published as IS 9899:2018.</p>
<p>This issue was not resolved in that publication.</p>
<p>A new paper <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2281.htm">N2281</a>
was discussed at some length for possible inclusion in a new edition of the
standard.</p>
<p>The committee believes that the goal of these papers is to establish a normative
requirement that calls to <code>mblen</code>, <code>mbtowc</code>, and <code>wctomb</code> be data-race free when
operating upon state-independent encodings. The committee notes that interleaved
calls to <code>setlocale</code> that change even among non-state-dependent encodings must
necessarily atomically change a reference to the encoding tables used by these
functions, and that such change would impede the desired speed advantage sought
by this change. Any assertion of data-race free must also disallow interleaved
calls to <code>setlocale</code> to maintain the speed advantage.</p>
<p>It was also noted in earlier discussions that some implementations are known to
use shared state even for non-state dependent encodings.</p>
<p>A new paper is solicited from the author for inclusion in a new edition of the
standard. An affirmative statement is requested, perhaps along the lines of: The
total order of <code>mblen</code>, <code>mbtowc</code>, and <code>wctomb</code> shall be data-race free when
there are no calls to <code>setlocale</code> in that order and, proabably, that a
state-indepenent encoding has been determined by a call to <code>mblen</code> in the
normative manner.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>5.2.4.2.2#9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Except for assignment and cast (which remove all extra range and precision), the
values yielded by operators with floating operands and values subject to the
usual arithmetic conversions and of floating constants are evaluated to a format
whose range and precision may be greater than required by the type. The use of
evaluation formats is characterized by the implementation-defined value
of <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code>:</p>
<p><code>-1</code> indeterminable;</p>
<p><code>0</code> evaluate all operations and constants just to the range and precision of the
type;</p>
<p><code>1</code> evaluate operations and constants of type <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> to the range
and precision of the <code>double</code> type, evaluate <code>long double</code> operations and
constants to the range and precision of the <code>long double</code> type;</p>
<p><code>2</code> evaluate all operations and constants to the range and precision of the
<code>long double</code> type.</p>
<p>All other negative values for <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> characterize
implementation-defined behavior</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the values yielded by operators with floating operands and values subject to the
usual arithmetic conversions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the first sentence mean the same as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interpretation 1: the values yielded by operators with: (a) floating operands
and (b) values subject to the usual arithmetic conversions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interpretation 2: (a) the values yielded by operators with floating operands and
(b) the values subject to the usual arithmetic conversions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interpretation 2 is problematic because the evaluation methods pertain only to
operators that return a value of floating type, not to, for example, the
relational operators with floating operands. Nor do they apply to all values
subject to the usual arithmetic conversions, and so (b) doesn’t add anything.
Thus, reasonableness suggests Interpretation 1. However, the mention of
assignment and cast (which are not subject to the usual arithmetic conversions)
suggests Interpretation 2.</p>
<p>Interpretation 2, unlike Interpretation 1, implies that values yielded by unary
operators are widened to the evaluation format. In some cases whether a unary
operator is widened matters. Widening a signaling NaN operand raises the
“invalid” floating-point exception. Widening an operand with a non-canonical
encoding canonicalizes the encoding.</p>
<p>The IEC 60559 <em>copy</em> and <em>negate</em> operations are bit manipulation operations
that affect at most the sign. C operations bound to these IEC 60559 operations
are expected to behave accordingly, but won’t if they entail widening.</p>
<p>Widening unary operators would introduce conversions that might affect
performance but which have no benefit.</p>
<p>According to personal notes, this issue came up at the WG14 meeting in Chicago
in 2013, but was not resolved and did not result in an action item.</p>
<p>Recently, this issue came up again as underlying the issue raised by Joseph
Myers in email SC22WG14.14278:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that with an implementation of C11 + TS 18661-1, that defines</p>
<p><code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> to <code>2</code>, you have:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">static</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">volatile</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">double</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #666666">=</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>SNAN;

(<span style="color: #B00040">void</span>)<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>x;
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Suppose also that the implementation defines the "<code>(void) x;</code>" statement to</p>
<p>constitute an access to volatile-qualified <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>May the implementation define that access to convert <code>x</code> from the format of</p>
<p><code>double</code> to the format of <code>long double</code>, with greater range and precision,</p>
<p>that format being used to represent <code>double</code> operands in accordance with the</p>
<p>setting of <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code>, and thereby to raise the "invalid" exception?</p>
<p>That is, may a convertFormat operation be applied as part of</p>
<p>lvalue-to-rvalue conversion where <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> implies that a wider</p>
<p>evaluation format is in use?</p>
<p>Even without signaling NaNs, the issue can apply to the case of exact</p>
<p>underflow, which can be detected using pragmas from TS 18661-5, if the</p>
<p>wider format has extra precision but not extra range and so exact underflow
occurs on converting a subnormal value to the wider format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following suggested Technical Corrigendum is intended to clarify the wording
in favor of Interpretation 1, which excludes widening unary operators to the
evaluation format.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#9, replace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Except for assignment and cast (which remove all extra range and precision), the
values yielded by operators with floating operands and values subject to the
usual arithmetic conversions and of floating constants are evaluated to a format
whose range and precision may be greater than required by the type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The values of floating type yielded by operators subject to the usual
arithmetic conversions and the values of floating constants are evaluated to a
format whose range and precision may be greater than required by the type. In
all cases, assignment and cast remove all extra range and precision.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The current text is ambiguous. It might be read to imply that unary operators
must widen, which is not the intent since it would be incompatible with IEEE
60559. Widening can cause signaling NaNs to be triggered and representations to
be canonicalized.</p>

<h2>Issue 0501: Can <strong>DECIMAL_DIG</strong> be larger than necessary?</h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Jim Thomas<br />
Date: 2016-09-10<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2077.pdf">N2077</a><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is about the issue raised by Joseph Myers in email SC22WG14.14285:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C11 defines <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> as "number of decimal digits, <em>n</em>, such that any
floating-point number in the widest supported floating type with
<em>p<sub>max</sub></em> radix <em>b</em> digits can be rounded to a floating-point number
with <em>n</em> decimal digits and back again without change to the value," and then
gives a formula.</p>
<p>Is it OK for the value of <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> to be larger than given by the formula?
Such a value would still seem to meet the textual description, though being
suboptimal.</p>
<p>This is an issue for implementing TS 18661-3 when that involves types wider than
<code>long double</code>.  In C11, "real floating type" means <code>float</code>, <code>double</code> or <code>long double</code> (6.2.5#10) (and then those types plus the three complex types are
defined to be the floating types).  TS 18661-3 is supposed to be compatible with
C11, so that an implementation can conform to both simultaneously.  The
definition of <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> in TS 18661-3 covers all supported floating types
and non-arithmetic encodings.  And that's not conditional on
<code>__STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__</code>.  So in an implementation of TS 18661-3 that
supports <code>_Float128</code>, <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> must be big enough for <code>_Float128</code>, even if
<code>__STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__</code> is not defined when <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code> is included.
And that's only compatible with C11 (if <code>long double</code> is narrower than
<code>_Float128</code>) if C11 allows <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> to be larger than given by the formula.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. The current specification for <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> in TS 18661-3 is
incompatible with C11, as explained.</p>
<p>The suggested Technical Corrigendum below allows <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> to be larger than
the value of the given formula. Thus an implementation that supports a floating
type wider than <code>long double</code>, for example a wide type in TS 18661-3, could
define <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> to be large enough for its widest type and still conform as
a C implementation without extensions.</p>
<p>Where <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> is used to determine a sufficient number of digits, this
change might lead to conversions with more digits than needed and with more
digits than would have been used without the change. However, programs wishing
the minimal sufficient number of digit are better served by the type-specific
macros <code>FLT_DECIMAL_DIG</code>, etc.</p>
<p>We considered the alternative of changing TS 198661-3 to make <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>
dependent on <code>__STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__</code>.  But this could lead to errors
resulting from separately compiled parts of a program using inconsistent values
of <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#11, change the bullet defining <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—      number of decimal digits, <em>n</em>, such that any floating-point number in the
widest supported floating type with <em>p<sub>max</sub></em> radix <em>b</em> digits can be
rounded to a floating-point number with n decimal digits and back again without
change to the value,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt; … formula … &gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—      number of decimal digits, <em>n</em>, such that any floating-point number in the
widest supported floating type with <em>p<sub>max</sub></em> radix <em>b</em> digits can be
rounded to a floating-point number with n decimal digits and back again without
change to the value, at least</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt; … formula … &gt;</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee’s Proposed Committee Response and Proposed Technical Corrigendum
from the last meeting was discussed and a new paper
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2108.pdf">N2108</a> by the WG14
Floating Point study group was written and discussed at some length. After due
consideration the committee agreed with their conclusion that <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>
could not in fact be implemented properly, and adopted their Suggested Technical
Corrigendum below. For reference, the committee's previous direction can be
found in <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2109.htm">N2109</a> and
has been elided in this document.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternative input to the Proposed Change was presented in paper
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2211.htm">N2211</a> by the C
Floating Point working group.</p>
<p>N2108 suggested obsolescing <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>, as part of the resolution of CR 501.
This document updates the suggested CR in N2108 to eliminate references in C11
to <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>, and to clarify. Changes below (along with changes to TS
18661) were identified in N2211.</p>
<p>The Floating Point Study Group was requested to extract the changes for C from
N2211 and present them separately. This was done and presented (without change)
in paper <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2253.pdf">N2253</a> and
these changes were accepted by the committee as the proposed resolution to this
issue.</p>

<h3>Proposed Change</h3>
<p>In 7.31, add a subclause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>7.31.x Mathematics</strong> <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code></p>
<p>Use of the <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> macro is an obsolescent feature. A similar
type-specific macro, such as <code>LDBL_DECIMAL_DIG</code> can be used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#11, in the bullet defining <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>, attach a footnote to the
wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>DECIMAL_DIG

</blockquote>
<p>where the footnote is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*) See ‘‘future library directions’’ (7.31.x).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#14, change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[14] Conversion from (at least) <code>double</code> to decimal with <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> digits
and back should be the identity function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[14] Conversion between real floating type and decimal character sequence with
at most <em>T</em><code>_DECIMAL_DIG</code> digits should be correctly rounded, where <em>T</em> is the
macro prefix for the type. This assures conversion from real floating type to
decimal character sequence with <em>T</em><code>_DECIMAL_DIG</code> digits and back, using
to-nearest rounding, is the identity function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#16, in the list of macro values in EXAMPLE 2, omit:</p>

<p>In 5.2.4.2.2#16, at the end of EXAMPLE 2, omit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a type wider than <code>double</code> were supported, then <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> would be
greater than 17. For example, if the widest type were to use the minimal-width
IEC 60559 double-extended format (64 bits of precision), then <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>
would be 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 7.21.6.1#13 and 7.29.2.1#13, change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[13] For <code>e</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>F</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>G</code> conversions, if the number of

correctly rounded.283) If the number of significant decimal digits is more than
<code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> but the source value is exactly representable with <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code>
digits, then the result should be an exact representation with trailing zeros.
Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings <em>L</em> &lt;
<em>U</em>, both having <code>DECIMAL_DIG</code> significant digits; the value of the resultant
decimal string <em>D</em> should satisfy <em>L</em> ≤ <em>D</em> ≤ <em>U</em>, with the extra stipulation
that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 3</strong> in paragraph 26 of <strong>§6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers</strong>
shows a valid definition of a struct containing both an anonymous struct and a
flexible array member:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>–26–   EXAMPLE 3   Because members of anonymous structures and unions are
considered to be members of the containing structure or union, <code>struct s</code> in the
following example has more than one named member and thus the use of a flexible

</blockquote>
<p>Now consider the following ever so slightly modified but seemingly equivalent
version of the same example. Is it also valid?</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">s</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{

<span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span>};
</pre></div>

<p>Paragraph 13 of the section referenced above specifies that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An unnamed member whose type specifier is a structure specifier with no tag is
called an anonymous structure; [...]. The members of an anonymous structure or
union are considered to be members of the containing structure or union. This
applies recursively if the containing structure or union is also anonymous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, paragraph 18 of the same section defines a <em>flexible array member</em>
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a special case, the last element of a structure with more than one named
member may have an incomplete array type; this is called a <em>flexible array
member</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A possible interpretation of these two paragraphs applied to the modified
example above is that, since the flexible array member <code>a</code> is considered to be a
member of <code>struct s</code> that has a preceding data member and no members following
the anonymous struct, the example is valid.</p>
<p>However, another possible interpretation (offered in reflector message
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14299" title="flexible array
member in an anonymous struct">SC22WG14.14299</a>) is that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...the layout [of a struct containing an anonymous struct] is exactly as if
the contained anonymous structure or union had a name (so it acts like a
structure is declared as such even if contained in a union, or like a union if
declared as such even if contained in a structure), with all the usual
constraints applying to the contained structure or union, and the only
difference being a shorthand notation for naming members of the contained
structure or union.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to this interpretation, the defintion in the example is not valid.
This interpretation appears to be reflected in the behavior of a number of
tested implementations: they all diagnose it, indicating that a flexible array
may not be the sole member of a struct.</p>
<p>We believe both of these interpretations are reasonable and the standard,
therefore, to be ambiguous on this point. In addition, despite support for the
latter interpretation in existing practice, we don't know of any technical
reason to disallow flexible arrays as sole members in anonymous structs.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the lack of clarity in this area has also given rise to
DR <a href="log_c11c17.html#issue0499">499</a>.</p>
<p>As a separate issue, the definition of a flexible array member cited above
refers to such a member as an <em>element</em> of a structure. This is unusual (and
raises a question about the meaning of the word in this context) because the
term element is otherwise reserved to refer to elements of an array or to
enumerators, but not to members of structures. If the text doesn't intend to
differentiate flexible array members from other members beyond the explicitly
spelled out constraints it should make use of the word member consistently and
avoid using the term <em>element</em>.</p>
<h3>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</h3>
<p>The standard needs to be clarified to avoid the ambiguity discussed above.</p>
<p>We suggest that the standard be made clear that defining a flexible array as the
sole member of an anonymous struct is permitted as long as the flexible array is
not the sole member of the enclosing object.</p>
<p>Since we believe the standard can already be interpreted as proposed, we suggest
to add a new paragraph to the end of <strong>§6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers</strong>
with the following text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>–27–   EXAMPLE 4   Similarly to example 3, since the flexible array member <code>a</code>
defined in the anonymous struct is considered a member of the enclosing <code>struct t</code> that declares a preceding named member and no subsequent members, the use of
the flexible array member is valid:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">t</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">        </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>i;
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">        </span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">struct</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>{<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span><span style="color: #B00040">int</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>a[];<span style="color: #bbbbbb"> </span>};
<span style="color: #bbbbbb">    </span>};
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>In addition, we suggest that the word <em>element</em> in the definition of the term
<em>flexible array member</em> be replaced with the word <em>member</em> (or, alternatively,
that the meaning of the term element in this context be defined and clearly
distinguished from other uses of the term in the text such as those referring to
elements of arrays).</p>
<p>To that end, we propose to modify <strong>§6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers</strong>,
paragraph 18, as indicated below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>–18–   As a special case, the last <ins>member</ins> <del>element</del> of a
structure with more than one named member may have an incomplete array type;
this is called a <em>flexible array member</em>. …</p>

<p>After further discussion and review, the committee does not support the

</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The committee does not support the interpretation that §6.7.2.1 paragraph 13
overrides the paragraph 18. No struct or union, even anonymous, should have a
size of zero, and since the effect desired is easily achieved, there is no
motivation for creating a second mechanism to achieve that purpose.</p>

<h2>Issue 0503: Hexadecimal floating-point and <code>strtod</code></h2>
<p>Authors: WG14, Clark Nelson<br />
Date: 2016-09-13<br />
Reference document: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2082.htm">N2082</a><br />
Status: Closed<br />
Converted from: <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2396.htm">n2396.htm</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>C11 7.22.1.3 paragraph 3 bullet 2 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code>, then a nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally
containing a decimal-point character, then an optional binary exponent part as
defined in 6.4.4.2;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the grammar in C11 6.4.4.2 makes the binary-exponent-part mandatory, not
optional.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested resolution</strong></p>
<p>Strike "optional" before "binary exponent part" and add a comma before "as
defined in" to highlight that "as defined in" applies to the entire sentence,
not only to the last part.</p>

<h3>Committee Discussion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This turns out to not be a defect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Proposed Committee Response</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The reference to §6.4.4.2 is only for the definition of "binary exponent part",
it does not apply to the entire sentence. The specification of allowable subject
sequences for these library functions is intentionally looser than the grammar
for floating constants in order to accept as many reasonable input strings as
possible. Thus, both 123 and 0x123 are valid subject sequences even though
neither is acceptable as a floating constant.</p>
