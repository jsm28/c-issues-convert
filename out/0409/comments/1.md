Feb 2012 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> * The committee rejected the Suggested Change in the main body of this defect report.
> * The committee considered the following, but rejected it (as just being a restatement of 7.12.1 paragraphs 4 and 5).
>   > If the result overflows, a range error shall occur.
> * A question arose as to why these range error cases are listed in the individual functions (instead of just being covered by the blanket 7.12.1 paragraphs 4, 5, and 6\)
>   
>   7.12.1 paragraph 1 has the answer:
>   
>   > The behavior of each of the functions in \<math.h\> is specified for all
>   > representable values of its input arguments, except where stated otherwise.
> * Several other approaches were discussed, without any consensus reached
>   1. Add a footnote to 7.12.1 paragraph 5, first sentence:
>      > In an implementation that supports infinities, a range error may happen for
>      > functions that map an infinity argument into an exact infinity or exact zero
>      > result.
>   2. Add to end of 7.12.1 paragraph 4:
>      > Recommended practice
>      > 
>      > In an implementation that supports infinities, a range error should not happen
>      > for functions that map an infinity argument into an exact infinity or exact zero
>      > result.
>   3. Add to 7.12.1 paragraph 4:
>      > An implementation may define additional range errors, provided that such errors
>      > are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function.

Oct 2012 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> * Fred wrote a paper [N1629](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1629.htm) discussing "Fixing a contradiction" and "Taking care of infinity".
> * The definition of range error, however, in 7.12.1 paragraph 4 indicates infinity is excluded (since it has a representation), and as such no change is required.

### Committee Discussion

> Fred presented another paper
> [N1979](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1979.htm) noting an
> error in the October 2012 committee response, and after discussion, the proposed
> clarification was adopted, and is as follows

### Proposed Committee Response

The definition of range error in 7.12.1 paragraph 4 excludes infinity.

For example, `exp(+infinity)` is `+infinity`. Since the input `+infinity` is
representable, then the output `+infinity` is representable in an object of the
specified type. By, 7.12.1 paragraph 4, a range error has not happened. Also, by
7.12.1 paragraph 5, since the result is not finite, overflow has not happened.
