### Response

From subclause 3.14, an object is “a region of data storage ... Except for
bit-fields, objects are composed of contiguous sequences of one or more bytes,
the number, order, and encoding of which are either explicitly specified or
implementation-defined ...” From subclause 7.11.1, “the header `<string.h>`
declares one type and several functions, and defines one macro useful for
manipulating arrays of character type and other objects treated as arrays of
character type.” “Various methods are used for determining the lengths of the
arrays...” From subclause 7.11.2.1, description of `memcpy`, “if copying takes
place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.” Therefore, the
“objects” referred to by subclause 7.11.2.1 are exactly the regions of data
storage pointed to by the pointers and dynamically determined to be of `N` bytes
in length (i.e. treated as an array of `N` elements of character type).

a. So, no, the objects are not “the largest objects into which the arguments can
be construed as pointing.”

b. In Example 1, the call to `memcpy` has defined behavior.

c. The behavior is defined because the pointers point into different
(non-overlapping) objects.
