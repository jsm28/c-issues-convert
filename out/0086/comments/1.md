### Response

The question asks whether a system header can define the name of a library
function as an object-like macro, and cites subclause 7.1.7 as not using the
term “function-like.”

The Committee notes the absence of this term, but also notes that subclause
7.1.7 requires that the macro definition always be suppressed when not followed
by an open parenthesis. Therefore such macros must either be function-like, or
the implementation must cause them to act as function-like macros.
