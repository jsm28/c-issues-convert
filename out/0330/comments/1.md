### Committee Discussion

In the Rationale, please add to section 6.5 Expressions, as a new paragraph,
words along the lines of:

> The "inexact" floating-point exception is NOT an exceptional condition because
> "inexact" arises from computing a mathematically defined value in the range of
> representable values, therefore, from the definition, "inexact" is not
> exceptional. This matters for spurious exceptional conditions in the math
> library (7.12.1).

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Change 7.12.1 paragraph 1 last sentence to:

> Each function shall execute as if it were a single operation without generating
> any of the exceptions "invalid", "divide-by-zero", or "overflow" except to
> reflect the result of the function.
