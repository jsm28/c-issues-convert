### Response

a. Example:

```c
void f(int c, char a[sizeof(c)]);
```

The reference to `c` is an expression because the previously declared identifier
designates a function parameter (cf. subclause 6.5.4.3), which is an object
(subclause 3.15), thus meeting the requirement in subclause 6.3.1.

b. Another example:

```c
int i;
 struct {
 int i;
 char a[sizeof(i)];
 };
```

In C, this is okay. Subclause 6.1.2.3, **Name spaces of identifiers**, requires
that `i` in the `sizeof` expression refers to the external `i`, not the member.
