### Response

This program's behavior is undefined because of the restriction on inclusion of
standard headers in subclause 7.1.2:

The program shall not have any macros with names lexically identical to keywords
currently defined prior to the inclusion.

The Committee's intention was indeed to otherwise allow macros to mask keywords.
