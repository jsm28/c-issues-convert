Technical Corrigendum

In subclause 7.10.3, change the next to last sentence to read:

If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is implementation
defined: either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior is as if the size
were some unspecified nonzero value, except that the returned pointer shall not
be used to access an object.
