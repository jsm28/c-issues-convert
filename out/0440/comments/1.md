### Proposed Committee Response

> To do as suggested, distinguish whether `float`, `double`, and `long double` are
> IEC or not, requires the addition of new macros, which is a feature, which is
> not allowed by the mechanism of defect reports.
>
> The defect originator notes that the underlying issue that needs consideration
> in any further comprehensive publication of the Standard is that all
> implementation defined behaviors need to be strictly called out in the Standard,
> and moreover that they be done so in a manner that is accessible to a client of
> the implementation to allow proper choice of algorithms. It has been asserted
> that leaving implementation defined behaviors formally undefined in the Standard
> has led to significant and unnecessary divergences in implementations.
