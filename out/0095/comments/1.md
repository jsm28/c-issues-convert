### Response

An explicit constraint is not required in the initializer section. Early on, the
Committee decided that if a behavior was described as being equivalent to
another construct, all of the constraints of that construct would apply. This
“chaining” process means that any violation of a constraint in any section
referred to explicitly or by the phrases “equivalent behavior” or “as if” will
generate a diagnostic.

The constraints in the section on simple assignment (subclause 6.3.16.1) are
sufficient to assure type compatibility of the object and the initializer.
