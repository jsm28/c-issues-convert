Oct 2012 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> * The standard deliberately does not specify values for the clear and set states of `atomic_flag` objects in order to support the widest possible set of architectures.
> * The change suggested could be viewed as a proposal, but should be submitted as such, and since C11 shares the same memory model as C\+\+11 a corresponding proposal should be submitted to WG21 as well.

### Proposed Committee Response

The standard deliberately does not specify values for the clear and set states
of atomic\_flag objects in order to support the widest possible set of
architectures. As such, the committee does not believe that this is a defect.
