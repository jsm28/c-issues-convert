### Response

Subclause 5.1.1.2, page 5, lines 32-39 indicate that translation must proceed as
if all creation of preprocessing tokens completes before any macro expansion
begins. These are translation phases 3 and 4:

> 3\. The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens and sequences of
> white-space characters (including comments)...
>
> 4\. Preprocessing directives are executed and macro invocations are expanded.

Therefore, if `X+Y` were expanded to `0x000E+Y`, a new preprocessing number
would not be created. The macro expansion proceeds as follows.

```c
FOO(X+Y) (6 tokens) --
 FOO(0x000E+0x0100) (6 tokens) --
 0x000E+0x0100 (3 tokens)
```

This sequence is required by subclause 6.8.3.1, page 90, lines 10-14:

> A parameter in the replacement list ... is replaced by the corresponding
> argument after all macros contained therein have been expanded. Before being
> substituted, each argument's preprocessing tokens are completely macro replaced
> as if they formed the rest of the translation unit...
