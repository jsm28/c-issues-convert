Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* This issue arises because of the different architectures of a buffered stream which can hold pushed back characters, and that of the underlying filesystem which honors seek independent of the buffering.
* The committee sentiment is that the suggested changes are nearly correct and have requested that the project editor suggest better wording, subject to further discussion.

### Committee Discussion

> The Standard is correct as written because the intent is that the specified file
> position indicator is an intermediate state inside the file positioning function
> after the pushed-back characters are discarded but before the actual seek. That
> gives you a reliable file position from which to do the seek. It's not intended
> that the file positioning function doesn't set the file position indicator.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Add a footnote to 7.21.7.10 paragraph 5, second sentence:

> Note that a file positioning function may further modify the file position
> indicator after discarding any pushed-back characters.

Add a footnote to 7.29.3.10 paragraph 5, second sentence:

> Note that a file positioning function may further modify the file position
> indicator after discarding any pushed-back wide characters.
