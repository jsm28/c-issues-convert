Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The following words were discussed extensively and thought appropriate as appropriate for inclusion in F.3, rather than a new F.4:
  > If an exceptional condition occurs during the evaluation of an expression (that
  > is, if the result is not mathematically defined or not in the range of
  > representable values for its type), and the behaviour is not defined in this
  > annex or by reference to IEC 60559, 6.5p5 applies and the behaviour is
  > undefined.
* The committee also suggested adding an example or footnote suggesting that this would apply to a non-IEC 60550 `long double`.

### Committee Discussion

> Further correspondence with the author and excerpted in
> [N1804](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1804.htm) has
> identified the core issue as being a simple misunderstanding of the
> applicability of normative annexes to the standard.

### Proposed Committee Response

> WG14 treats normative annexes such as Annex F as if they were linear extensions
> of the standard itself. When Annex F is requested via definition of
> `__STDC_IEC_559__` then 6.5#5 is superseded and floating point exceptions become
> well defined.
