Oct 2013 meeting

### Proposed Committee Response

> After reviewing the original motivation and suggestion for change, it was noted
> by the project editor that "character" is used in several distinct contexts, and
> that it would be inappropriate to simply improve one area without a
> comprehensive review of all uses such that the existing consistency of uses of
> character be replaced in a consistent new manner, as yet undetermined. As it
> stands, although careful reading is strictly required, it is correct and as such
> this is not a defect.
