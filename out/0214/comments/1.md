### Committee Response

There are many conditions under which any library function or language feature
may fail or behave in an undefined manner. Some examples:

* All of memory has been allocated
* The stack has overflowed

As such, it is a quality of implementation issue under what conditions any
library function, including `atexit()`, may fail.

There is no consensus to make the suggested change or any change along this
line.
