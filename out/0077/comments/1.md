### Response

The C Standard does not explicitly state that the address of an object remains
constant throughout the life of the object. That this is the intent of the
Committee can be inferred from the fact that an address constant is considered
to be a constant expression. The framers of the C Standard considered that it
was so obvious that addresses should remain constant that they neglected to
craft words to that effect.

The Committee should revisit this issue during the revision of the C Standard.
