Problem: TR 18037 has in many places the text fragment 'overflow and rounding',
but has also the text 'rounding and overflow'.

Solution: Defect 2 has established that the required order is first to do
rounding and then to do overflow handling; make the text consistent by replacing
the text fragment 'overflow and rounding' by 'rounding and overflow' throughout
the document.

Change: Make the required change in many places (including the title of 4.1.3
and A.4).
