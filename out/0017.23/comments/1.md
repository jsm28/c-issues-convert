### Response

The reference is to subclause 6.8.3.4, page 91\.

```c
#define a(x) b
 #define b(x) x
 a(a)(a)(a)      /*  may expand as follows: */
 b(a)(a)
 a'(a)   or       a(a)
 a(a)            or       b
 /* a' indicates the symbol a marked for non-replacement */
```

The Committee addressed this issue explicitly in previous deliberations and
decided to say nothing about the situation, understanding that behavior in such
cases would be undefined.

The result, as with other examples, is intentionally left undefined.
