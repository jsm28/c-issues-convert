Item 30 \- reservation of identifiers

Can a conforming freestanding implementation reserve identifiers? Subclause
5.1.2.1 states that only one identifier (the equivalent of `main`) is reserved
in a freestanding implementation. Subclause 7.1.3 states that certain
identifiers are reserved, even when the corresponding headers are not included.
This is a direct contradiction.
