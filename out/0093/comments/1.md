### Response

The Committee observes that conforming freestanding implementations tend to vary
widely in the library facilities provided, and that the simple binary choice
implied by the above text is really a continuum. It also notes that it is
difficult to provide a C implementation with no reserved names (not even those
beginning with two underscores). It is therefore felt to be unreasonable to
restrict the names available to implementors of freestanding implementations
compared with hosted implementations.

The Committee notes that certain freestanding programs (such as UNIX kernels)
have tended to use names such as `exit`, but agrees that existing practice
dictates that the authors of such programs must already be prepared to change
such names when using certain compilers.

### Correction

***In subclause 5.1.2.1, page 6, delete:***

There are otherwise no reserved external identifiers.
