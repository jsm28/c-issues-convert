### Technical Corrigendum

Change 6.10.1#3 to read:

> ...
> 
> and then each preprocessing token is converted into a token. The resulting
> tokens compose the controlling constant expression which is evaluated according
> to the rules of 6.6. For the purposes of this token conversion and evaluation
> all signed integer types and all unsigned integer types act as if they have the
> same representation as, respectively, the types `intmax_t` and `uintmax_t`
> defined in the header `<stdint.h>`.

Add a footnote to the end of 6.10.1#3 to read:

> Thus on an implementation where `INT_MAX` is 0x7FFF and `UINT_MAX` is 0xFFFF,
> the constant 0x8000 is signed and positive within a `#if` expression even though
> it is unsigned in translation phase 7\.
