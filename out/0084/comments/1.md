### Response

From subclause 6.5.2.3, the incomplete type specified by the tag may be used,
unless the size of the corresponding object is needed.

In responding to Defect Reports, the Committee has discussed at length when the
size of an object is actually required. The C Standard is inconclusive with
regard to whether or not the size of the structure is needed in the example
given, leaving the behavior undefined.

The Committee should revisit this issue during the revision of the C Standard.
