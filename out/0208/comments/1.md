### Committee Response

The question asks about the expression

> ```c
> int a [2] = { f (0), f (1), [0] = f (2) };
> ```

and the meaning of the wording

> each initializer provided for a particular subobject overriding any previously
> listed initializer for the same subobject;

It was the intention of WG14 that the call `f(0)` might, but need not, be made
when `a` is initialized. If the call *is* made, the order in which `f(0)` and
`f(2)` occur is unspecified (as is the order in which `f(1)` occurs relative to
both of these). Whether or not the call is made, the result of `f(2)` is used to
initialize `a[0]`.

The wording of paragraph 23:

> The order in which any side effects occur among the initialization list
> expressions is unspecified.

should be taken to only apply to those side effects which actually occur.

### Technical Corrigendum

In 6.7.8 paragraph 19, attach a footnote to "the same subobject":

> \[\*\] Any initializer for the subobject which is overridden and so not used to
> initialize that subobject might not be evaluated at all.
