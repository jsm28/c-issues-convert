### Technical Corrigendum

Change footnote 5 (5.1.1.2p1):

> Implementations shall behave as if these separate phases occur, even though many
> are typically folded together in practice. <u>Source files, translation units
> and translated translation units need not necessarily be stored as files, nor
> need there be any one-to-one correspondence between these entities and any
> external representation. The description is conceptual only, and does not
> specify any particular implementation.</u>
