### Committee Discussion (for history only)

#### Spring 2007

On some hardware (e.g. Itanium), an 8-bit value may have as many as 257
different values (0-255 and a "Not a Thing" value). However, c99 explicitly
forbids such a value for an unsigned char.

Page 6, 3.17.2, change the definition of *indeterminate value* to:

> either an unspecified value or a trap representation; or in the case of an
> object of automatic storage duration whose address is never taken, a value that
> behaves as if it were a trap representation.

5.1.2.3 para 5 second bullet speaks to this also.

#### Fall 2007

See WG14 e-mail *SC22WG14.11380*

While some agreed with the comments in this email others did not.

#### Spring 2008

Regarding WG14 e-mail *SC22WG14.11380*, the observations about trap
representations are correct, and it is unfortunate that the DR was written in a
way that relied on trap representation terminology and behavior. In fact, the
problem and solution are not really related to *trap representation* as defined
in the standard at all.

A better way to describe the issue might be to talk about use of an
uninitialized object that is eligible to have register storage class (i.e. an
object of automatic storage duration whose address is never taken).

Also the original DR's suggested wording change was made in the definition of
*indeterminate value*. The reason for that was to trigger undefined behavior,
which would have worked in C90, but in C99 the definition of undefined behavior
was changed such that it does not mention indeterminate value.

**Change for C1X:**

> 6.3.2.1 paragraph 2, add a sentence to the end:
>
> > If the lvalue designates an object of automatic storage duration that could have
> > been declared with register storage class (never had its address taken), and
> > that object is uninitialized (not declared with an initializer, and no
> > assignment to it has been performed prior to the use), the behavior is
> > undefined.
