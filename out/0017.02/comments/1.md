### Response

You are correct that it is implicitly undefined behavior if the executable does
not contain a function called `main`. This was a conscious decision of the
Committee.

There are many places in the C Standard that leave behavior implicitly
undefined. The Committee chose as a style for the C Standard not to enumerate
these places as explicitly undefined behavior. Rather, subclause 3.16, page 3,
lines 12-16 explicitly allow for implicitly undefined behavior and explicitly
give implicitly undefined behavior equal status with other forms of undefined
behavior.

### Correction

***Add to subclause G.2, page 200:***

\- A program contains no function called `main` (5.1.2.2.1).
