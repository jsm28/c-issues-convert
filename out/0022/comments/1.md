### Correction

***In subclause 7.9.6.2, page 135, lines 31-33, change:***

An input item is defined as the longest matching sequence of input characters,
unless that exceeds a specified field width, in which case it is the initial
subsequence of that length in the sequence.

***to:***

An input item is defined as the longest sequence of input characters which does
not exceed any specified field width and which is, or is a prefix of, a matching
input sequence.

***In subclause 7.9.6.2, page 137, delete:***

If conversion terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending input
character is left unread in the input stream.

***Add to subclause 7.9.6.2, page 137:***

If conversion terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending input
character is left unread in the input stream.\* \[Footnote \*: `fscanf` pushes
back at most one input character onto the input stream. Therefore, some
sequences that are acceptable to `strtod`, `strtol`, or `strtoul` are
unacceptable to `fscanf`.]
