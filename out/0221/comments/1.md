### Committee Response

> 1\. `int v[10];`  
> 2\. `int *p = (v + 9) + 1;`  
> 3\. `int *q = v + 10;`

Simply put, `10 == 9+1`. Based on the "as-if" rule, there is no semantic
distinction among any of the following:

> ```c
> v+9+1
> (v+9)+1
> v+(9+1)
> v+10
> ```

and that `v+x` is equivalent to `(v+x-1)+1` and `(v+x+1)-1`, assuming that
`x>=1` and `x<=9`.

Furthermore, the following wording from 6.5.6P8 confirms this equivalence:

> "Moreover, if the expression `P` points to the last element of an array object,
> the expression `(P)+1` points one past the last element of the array object, and
> if the expression `Q` points one past the last element of an array object, the
> expression `(Q)-1` points to the last element of the array object."

The first part of the sentence states that `(v+9)+1` "points to one past the
last element of the array object".

The second part of the sentence states that `v+10` "points to one past the last
element of the array object", which equates it to `(v+9)+1` because it also
"points to one past the last element of the array object".

The third part of the sentence states that `v+10-1` "points to the last element
of the array object" which is `v+9`.

Additionally, the expression `(v+11)-2` need not be valid because constants
might not be folded and the expression `(v+11)` is invalid.

There are no surprising results in any of the above conclusions, even if the
above constants are replaced with variables. The committee believes the current
specification is clear and is unlikely to be misinterpreted.

There is no consensus to make the requested changes or any changes along these
lines.
