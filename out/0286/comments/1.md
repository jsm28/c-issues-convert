### Committee Discussion

This needs to be passed by the original authors to see if there is some
rationale for the multiple terminology. No real opposition to the Suggested
Technical Corrigendum, the Committee does not feel a need to rush this change.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change 3.9 'effective rounding mode' to 'current rounding mode'.

Change 7.12.13.1 The `fma` functions: '... the rounding mode characterized by
the value of `FLT_ROUNDS`' to '... the current rounding mode'.

Change Annex F.5 Binary-decimal conversion: Paragraph 2: 'correctly rounded' to
'correctly rounded (which honors the current rounding mode)'.
