### Response

For an array of arrays, the permitted pointer arithmetic in subclause 6.3.6,
page 47, lines 12-40 is to be understood by interpreting the use of the word
“object” as denoting the specific object determined directly by the pointer's
type and value, *not* other objects related to that one by contiguity.
Therefore, if an expression exceeds these permissions, the behavior is
undefined. For example, the following code has undefined behavior:

```c
int a[4][5];

 a[1][7] = 0;    /* undefined */
```

Some conforming implementations may choose to diagnose an “array bounds
violation,” while others may choose to interpret such attempted accesses
successfully with the “obvious” extended semantics.

### Correction

***Add to subclause G.2, page 201:***

\- An array subscript is out of range, even if an object is apparently
accessible with the given subscript (as in the lvalue expression `a[1][7]` given
the declaration `int a[4][5]`) (6.3.6).
