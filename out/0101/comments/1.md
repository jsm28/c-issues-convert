### Response

There are three questions about mismatched type qualifiers in places where
conversions “as if by assignment” takes place. Two of these are in
initialization and in function returns. A careful reading of the C Standard
shows that mismatched qualifiers are allowed in these two cases; see subclauses
6.5.7 and 6.5.3 **Semantics**.

The other issue deals with a qualifier mismatch between arguments and the
parameters of a called function. The C Standard should be modified to clarify
that such a mismatch is allowed.

### Correction

***In subclause 6.3.2.2, page 41, second paragraph, change:***

If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that includes a
prototype, the arguments are implicitly converted, as if by assignment, to the
types of the corresponding parameters.

***to:***

If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that includes a
prototype, the arguments are implicitly converted, as if by assignment, to the
types of the corresponding parameters, taking the type of each parameter to be
the unqualified version of its declared type.
