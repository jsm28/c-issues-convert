### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Page 5: At the end of 5.3, insert:

> After 7.1.2#4, insert:
>
> > \[4a] Some standard headers define or declare identifiers contingent on whether
> > certain macros whose names begin with **\_STDC\_WANT\_IEC\_60559\_** and end
> > with **\_EXT\_** are defined (by the user) at the point in the code where the
> > header is first included. Within a preprocessing translation unit, the same set
> > of such macros shall be defined for the first inclusion of all such headers.
