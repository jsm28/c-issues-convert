### Response

This issue remains open. The C Standard as currently worded has the following
consequences:

1\) Subclause 6.3.3.2 requires the operand of `&` to be an lvalue designating an
object; `a[10]` is not an object.

2\) Subclause 6.3.3.2 requires the operand of `&` to be an lvalue; `NULL` is not
an lvalue.

Since the use of either construct prevents a program from being strictly
conforming, the remaining portion of the question is not applicable.

However, the Committee is not entirely comfortable with these restrictions and
may decide to relax them in resolving this issue.
