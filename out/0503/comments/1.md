Oct 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> This turns out to not be a defect.

### Proposed Committee Response

> The reference to ยง6.4.4.2 is only for the definition of "binary exponent part",
> it does not apply to the entire sentence. The specification of allowable subject
> sequences for these library functions is intentionally looser than the grammar
> for floating constants in order to accept as many reasonable input strings as
> possible. Thus, both 123 and 0x123 are valid subject sequences even though
> neither is acceptable as a floating constant.
