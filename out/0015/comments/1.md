### Response

As described in subclause 6.2.1.1, bit-fields that are being treated as unsigned
will promote according to the same rules as other unsigned types: if the width
is less than `int`, and `int` can hold all the values, then the promotion is to
`int`. Otherwise, promotion is to `unsigned int`.
