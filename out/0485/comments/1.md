Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The fundamental issue is the apparent inability to initialize atomic structures or unions due to the definition of the `ATOMIC_VAR_INIT` macro as taking a single argument. Some implementations have already taken the liberty of treating the macro as variadic for purposes of atomic structure initialization and moreover to also implicitly provide surrounding `{` and `}` that form the syntax for a structure initializer or compound literal as appropriate to the implementation.
* The committee agrees with the sentiment expressed in the suggested NOTE although the wording was not discussed.
* The suggested changes to 7.17.2.1 were not acceptable to the committee, however, and may not be needed at all since, in particular the declared type `C` is already the non-atomic version of the atomic type `A` of the variable being initialized. Use of the term “base type” is undefined in C for example.
* The committee requests that the author take this input under advisement in a new solicited paper that would, in effect, make explicit the extended practice.

### Committee Discussion

> A short paper was provided with a Suggested Technical Corrigendum and, although
> close, more work was solicited from the authors. The direction discussed by the
> committee was given that in the section `C` is defined to be the non-atomic
> equivalent of type `A`,
>
> * new wording must be provided to say it takes an initializer for an object of type `C`, and the macro expands to an object of type `A`, and that
> * the macro can be defined as in the Suggested Technical Corrigendum:
>
>   ```c
>       #define ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(...)
>   ```

### Committee Discussion

> The definition of `ATOMIC_VAR_INIT` as a macro is problematic. Several
> implementations use locks introduced by compiler magic for larger structures and
> the macro cannot provide for the proper initialization of a lock that is not
> visible. For these and other implementations, `ATOMIC_VAR_INIT` should be fully
> implemented as compiler magic.
>
> Since removing the definition of the macro is outside the scope of a DR, this
> issue may only be addressable in a future revision of the standard.

Apr 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> Although discussed at the last meeting, the point that there are no known
> implementations using *embedded* locks was not accurately reflected in the prior
> discussion. Atomic structures may still differ in size due to potentially
> increased alignment requirements. It was further noted that some implementations
> use "compiler magic" at initialization time.
>
> Since the macro definition is neither necessary nor sufficient for structures,
> the email [(SC22WG14.14645) DR 485 wording for TC
> 2017](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14645) containing two suggested
> technical corrigenda was discussed at some length. Neither change, however, is
> appropriate as a technical corrigendum, and as such this issue cannot be
> addressed using the Defect Report process.

### Proposed Committee Response

> The `ATOMIC_VAR_INIT` macro was added to the standard without wide
> implementation experience with the intent being to allow implementations to use
> embedded locks in atomic types. It was not, however, well formulated to
> accommodate the extension of atomics to structures since it would, perhaps,
> require variadic arguments. No known implementations use embedded locks,
> however, and as such there is no technical requirement for the use of the
> `ATOMIC_VAR_INIT` macro.
>
> Correcting this is beyond the scope of the Defect Report process.
>
> There was consensus in the committee to deprecate this macro in the next
> revision of the standard. The following words, drawn from [(SC22WG14.14645) DR
> 485 wording for TC 2017](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14645), are the
> proposed direction:
>
> In §7.17.2.1 replace paragraph 2 with:
>
> > An atomic object with automatic storage duration that is not explicitly
> > initialized is initially in an indeterminate state.
