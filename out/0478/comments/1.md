Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee does not agree that any further clarification is needed in the
> standard. We know of no actual confusion in a practical sense on this matter. As
> such, the committee agrees with and draws substantially from [(SC22WG14.13787)
> RE: RE: RE: valid uses of main](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13780)
> in the formulation of its Proposed Committee Response below.

### Proposed Committee Response

> As there is no "only" in 5.1.2.2.2 the interpretation should be that the
> statement is granting permission, not making a restriction. It is drawing a
> distinction between freestanding environments, where only a subset of the
> library can be used, and hosted environments, where all of the library can be
> used. Programs are always free, in either kind of environment, to use things in
> addition to the library, like their own functions and objects. Additionally, the
> reference in 5.1.2.2.3 to the **initial** call to `main` strongly suggests that
> recursive calls are allowed.
