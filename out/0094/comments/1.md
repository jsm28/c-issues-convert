### Response

The constraint in the description of the `return` statement is unneeded. Early
on, the Committee decided that if a behavior was described as being equivalent
to another construct, all of the constraints of that construct would apply. This
“chaining” process means that any violation of a constraint in any section
referred to explicitly or by the phrases “equivalent behavior” or “as if” will
generate a diagnostic.

The **Semantics** section of the `return` statement (subclause 6.6.6.4) states:
“If the expression has a type different from that of the function in which it
appears, it is converted as if it were assigned to an object of that type.” The
constraints in the section on simple assignment (subclause 6.3.16.1) are
sufficient to assure assignment compatibility of the two types.
