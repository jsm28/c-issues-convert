### Response

Does the Standard guarantee that `p == i`? Yes.

Does `(int *) 0` yield a null pointer of type `int *`? Yes.

Does `1 ? 0 : (int *) 0` yield a null pointer of type `int *`? Yes.

The intent of the part of Subclause 6.2.2.3 that you quote is to state that a
null pointer results when a null pointer constant is converted to a pointer. By
singling out assignment and comparison, the Standard is misleadingly specific.
This should be clarified in the Standard.

### Future Change

In Subclause 6.2.2.3

Change

> "If a null pointer constant is assigned to or compared for equality to a
> pointer, the constant is converted to a pointer of that type. Such a pointer,
> called a null pointer, is guaranteed to compare unequal to a pointer to any
> object or function.
>
> Two null pointers, converted through possibly different sequences of casts to
> pointer types, shall compare equal."

To

> "The result of converting a null pointer constant to a pointer type is called a
> null pointer. A null pointer is guaranteed to compare unequal to a pointer to
> any object or function.
>
> Conversion of a null pointer to another pointer type yields a null pointer of
> that type. Any two null pointers shall compare equal."

In Subclause 6.3.9

Add a new paragraph after the first paragraph in Semantics

> "If a null pointer constant is compared for equality to a pointer, the constant
> is converted to the type of the pointer."
