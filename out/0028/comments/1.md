### Response

Case 1: unions `f(&u.i, &u.d)`

Subclause 6.3.2.3, page 42, lines 5-6:

> ... if a member of a union object is accessed after a value has been stored in a
> different member of the object, the behavior is implementation-defined.

Therefore, an alias is not permitted and the optimization is allowed.

Case 2: declared objects `f((int *)&d, &d)`

Subclause 6.3, page 38, lines 18-27 list specific ways in which declared objects
can be accessed. Therefore, an alias is not permitted and the optimization is
allowed.

Case 3: any other, including `malloc`ed objects `f((int *)dp, dp)`

We must take recourse to intent. The intent is clear from the above two
citations and from Footnote 36 on page 38:

The intent of this list is to specify those circumstances in which an object may
or may not be aliased.

Therefore, this alias is not permitted and the optimization is allowed.

In summary, yes, the rules do apply to dynamically allocated objects.
