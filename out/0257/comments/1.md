### Committee Response

The current rules are the result of extensive previous deliberations. The
Committee does not see a defect here.

### Committee Discussion

1. The Committee agrees, but does not believe that this is a defect in the Standard (or a substantive problem). There is some support for changing the example.
2. This takes away the "visibility rule" and the Committee does not want to do that; this is related to [DR 236](issue:0236).
3. The Committee agrees, but does not believe a change is warranted at this time. This should be considered for a future revision of the Standard.
4. The Committee believes this is a separate issue, and should be a defect report (and possibly a new footnote). The defect report generated is [DR 283](issue:0283), also see [N980](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n980.htm).
