### Response

Subclause 6.1.2.5 says, “... pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of
compatible types shall have the same representation and alignment requirements.”

Subclause 6.5.2.1 says, “Each non-bit-field member of a structure or union
object is aligned in an implementation-defined manner appropriate to its type.”
And later, “There may therefore be unnamed padding within a structure object,
... as necessary to achieve the appropriate alignment.”

a) It is possible for an implementation to state generalized requirements to
satisfy subclause 6.1.2.5. These requirements may be further strengthened using
the implementation-defined behavior made available in subclause 6.5.2.1. Yes,
the alignment requirements can be different.

b) In several places the C Standard states that a single object may be treated
as an array of one element. Nowhere does it give permission for array element
types to have different alignment requirements from isolated object types.

c) `sizeof (t)` must indeed be a multiple of `A(t)`.

d) Yes. A structure object can have an alignment that is greater than the least
common multiple of the alignments of its members.

e) The phrase “necessary to achieve the appropriate alignment” is not considered
to mean the use of the minimum padding possible. The Committee does not see any
advantage to changing this phrase.

f) Yes. See answer to question (b). `sizeof (struct fred)` must equal `sizeof
a`.

g) Such sharing of storage by objects would cause the requirements of subclause
6.3 to be violated and is not allowed.
