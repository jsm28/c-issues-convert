### Response

a. Yes, for `memcpy`, a contiguous sequence of elements within an array can be
regarded as an object in its own right.

b. The objects are not the smallest contiguous sequence of bytes that can be
construed; they are exactly the regions of data storage starting at the pointer
and of `N` bytes in length.

c. Yes, the non-overlapping halves of array `b` can be regarded as objects in
their own rights.

d. The behavior (in Example 2\) is defined.

e. The definition of object is independent of the *method* of storage
allocation. The array length is determined by “various methods.” So, yes, the
behavior of each call of `memcpy` is well-defined.

f. All of the calls of `memcpy` (in Example 3\) give defined behavior.
