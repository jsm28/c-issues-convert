Oct 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

The committee accepted this as a DR because there was an intent to not be
gratuitously different than C\+\+, and yet this small drift occurred.

### Proposed Committee Response

> This small and unintended difference between the two languages is known and some
> of its uses were discussed. It also turns out that some C\+\+ compilers also
> know and allow this construct with a warning. Overall, the committee concludes
> that this is not an area we wish to change.
