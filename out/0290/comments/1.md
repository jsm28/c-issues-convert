### Committee Discussion

A floating object with storage-class `register` shall not have greater range or
precision than an `auto` object of the same type. The reason for this is the
assignment operator. The only way a register variable may be altered is via
assignment; and assignment removes all extra range and precision.

### Technical Corrigendum

In 5.2.4.2.2 Characteristics of floating types `<float.h>`, change paragraph 7
to:

> Except for assignment and cast (which remove all extra range and precision), the
> values of operations with floating operands and values subject to the usual
> arithmetic conversions and of floating constants are evaluated to a format whose
> range and precision may be greater than required by the type. The use of
> evaluation formats is characterized by the implementation-defined value of
> `FLT_EVAL_METHOD`:<sup>19\)</sup>

In 6.8.6.4 The return statement, add to footnote 136:

> The representation of floating-point values may have wider range or precision
> and is determined by `FLT_EVAL_METHOD`. A cast may be used to remove this extra
> range and precision.
