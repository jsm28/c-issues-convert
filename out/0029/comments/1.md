### Response

Subclause 6.1.2.6 says (by omission) that tags do not have to be the same for
structure, union, or enumeration types to be compatible in separate translation
units. Tags are used in succeeding declarations to ensure that they are of the
same type. They are not used for type compatibility.

Does “two structure, union, and enumeration types” mean “two structure types,
two union types, or two enumeration types?”

Answer: Yes.
