### Committee Discussion

Committee believes that Example 2 violates the aliasing rules in 6.5 paragraph
7:

> "an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among
> its members (including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate or contained
> union)."

In order to not violate the rules, function f in example should be written as:

```c
   union tag {
                int mi;
                double md;
        } u;
        void f(int *qi, double *qd) {
                int i = *qi + 2;
                u.md = 3.1;   // union type must be used when changing effective type
                *qd *= i;
        return;
        }
```

Example 1 is still open. The committee does not think that the suggested wording
is acceptable.

More discussion is found in reflector message #9337, and in the Curacao meeting
minutes [N973](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n973.txt) and in
the Santa Cruz meeting minutes
[N987](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n987.txt).  
The current situation requires more consideration, but general consensus seems
to be;

* Limit the use of pointers to union members,
* Consensus for the visible alias rule exists,
* The requirement of global knowledge is problematic,
* Common understanding is that the union declaration must be visible in the translation unit.

### Committee Response

Both programs invoke undefined behavior, by calling function `f` with pointers
`qi` and `qd` that have different types but designate the same region of
storage. The translator has every right to rearrange accesses to `*qi` and `*qd`
by the usual aliasing rules.
