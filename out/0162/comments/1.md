### Future Change

In subclause 7.12.3, change:

> Except for the `strftime` function, these functions return values in one of two
> static objects: a broken-down time structure and an array of `char`. Execution
> of any of the functions may overwrite the information returned in either of
> these objects by any of the other functions.

to:

> Except for the `strftime` function, these functions each return a pointer to one
> of two types of static objects: a broken-down time structure or an array of
> `char`. Execution of any of the functions that return a pointer to one of these
> object types may overwrite the information in any object of the same type
> pointed to by the value returned from any previous call to any of them.
