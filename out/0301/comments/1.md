### Committee Discussion

Footnote 173 in 7.6 paragraph 1 also describes intent of \<fenv.h\>. Footnote
180 in 7.6.2.3 paragraph 2 mentions exceptions as raised by floating-point
operations.

Some members would like FE\_BLUEMOON to be a valid macro (even though none of
the basic floating-point operations would raise it). Hence, they do not want to
require the FE\_\* macros to be side-effects of floating-point operations.

The current FE\_\* macros are unspecified as that was the best compromise that
could be agreed to by the various committee members when C99 was being
developed.

Not really a *defect*, but a *deficiency*.

Two Heads of Delegations would like LIA-1 added as a normative reference by C99
as a way to define floating-point in C.

Several members believe that nailing down floating-point would be a good thing,
but that the DR process is not the way to do it. Perhaps an amendment (similar
to how wide characters were added to C90) should be done to C99 as a way to
"clean up" floating-point. Several members would like 2.0\+3.0 being 5.0 to be
true.

Most of the proposed TC material should be added to the C Rationale.

This material could be added to C99 as Recommended Practice.

### Committee Response

This is not really a *defect*, but an area which could be addressed in a future
revision of the C Standard.
