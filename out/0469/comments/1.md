Oct 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee is sympathetic to this concern. A review uncovered the possible
> need to further specify the behavior of a recursive mutex. A new paper was
> solicited to discuss this and other issues and their proposed resolutions.

Apr 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The paper [N1907](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1907.pdf)
> was presented.
> 
> Issue 1 from that paper has already been addressed in [DR414](issue:0414)
> 
> Issue 2, that recursive mutex behavior is essentially unspecified, needs
> addressing, but the words provided are unclear about accounting for additional
> lock and matching unlocks. It may be necessary to introduce the notion of
> counting to express the nested pattern succinctly.
> 
> Issue 3, from the original paper, was thought by the committee to be worth
> addressing, although in which section was not clear to the committee.
> 
> A revised paper was solicited.

Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> No new papers were presented and a new paper was again solicited. It may be that
> the resolution to [DR 414](issue:0414) be folded into any Suggested Technical
> Corrigendum as well.

Apr 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> Papers [N2019](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2019.pdf) and
> [N2026](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2026.htm) were
> provided and discussed as potential resolutions. The second paper borrows from
> the similar POSIX description and makes the recursion count more explicit, and
> introduces *acquire* terminology. The preceding section on condition variables
> would be impacted by such changes, however, and a combined paper was solicited.
> 
> Section 2 from
> [N2019](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2019.pdf) needs to be
> reconciled with the first item from the PTC of [DR 416](issue:0416). It was also
> suggested that “or through program termination” be added.
> 
> [DR 479](issue:0479) and [DR 493](issue:0493) raise other issues that must be
> found in any committee approved Proposed Technical Corrigendum to this DR.

Oct 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> As noted above there are several related issues and there have been several
> attempts to accurately specify the missing information. Nomenclature changes
> affecting mutexes must additionally be reflected throughout *7.26.3 Condition
> variable functions*, and such extensive changes are not suited for rectification
> via the Defect Report process.
> 
> As such, this DR and those related are to be considered in a future version of
> this standard.

Apr 2018 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee solicited a combined resolution for these issues with those raised
> in [DR 479](issue:0479) and [DR 493](issue:0493).
> 
> It was noted that there may well be missing language to tie these operations to
> the formal memory model, e.g. total memory order. It may also be the case that
> implementations may need to add explicit barriers in their wrappers in order to
> achieve C semantics. In no event shall C impose new requirements directly upon
> any underlying OS implementations.

Oct 2018 meeting

### Committee Response

> The "C17" edition of the standard has been published as IS 9899:2018.
> 
> These issues were not resolved in that publication.
> 
> The committee is now considering changes for the next revision of the standard,
> and asks that issues from [CR 469](issue:0469), [CR 479](issue:0479), and [CR
> 493](issue:0493), as well as potentially other small issues be combined in a new
> paper to completely resolve this issue for the next revision of the standard.
