### Response

Strictly conforming programs cannot depend on unspecified or
implementation-defined behavior (cf. clause 4, page 3, lines 31-32). Note that
`@` and `$` are extended source characters. Source characters are translated to
execution characters in an unspecified manner (cf. subclause 5.2.1). This is in
the `"C"` locale. The `@` character is either a printing character or a control
character, either of which is implementation-defined (subclause 7.3, page 102,
lines 8-11). Therefore, the program is *not* strictly conforming.
