Apr 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> After discussion, the committee concluded that `mbstate` was already specified
> to handle this case, and as such the second interpretation is intended. The
> committee believes that there is an underspecification, and solicited a further
> paper from the author along the lines of the second option. Although not
> discussed a Suggested Technical Corrigendum can be found at
> [N2040](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2040.htm).

### Committee Discussion

> The paper [N2040](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2040.htm).
> was discussed and found inadequate: it does not link the first call with the
> second as is intended by the standard.
> 
> Additional input was solicited and found in [(SC22WG14.14481) DR488 Suggested
> Corrigendum](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14481) and is repeated
> below:

In 7.28.1.2 paragraph 3, change:

> If `s` is not a null pointer, the `c16rtomb` function determines the number of
> bytes needed to represent the multibyte character that corresponds to the wide
> character given by `c16` (including any shift sequences), and stores the
> multibyte character representation in the array whose first element is pointed
> to by `s`.

to:

> If `s` is not a null pointer, the `c16rtomb` function determines the number of
> bytes needed to represent the multibyte character that corresponds to the wide
> character given or completed by `c16` (including any shift sequences), and
> stores the multibyte character representation in the array whose first element
> is pointed to by `s`, or stores nothing if `c16` does not represent a complete
> character.
