### Correction

***In subclause 6.1.2.6, page 25, lines 19-20, change:***

For an identifier with external or internal linkage declared in the same scope
as another declaration for that identifier, the type of the identifier becomes
the composite type.

***to:***

For an identifier with internal or external linkage declared in a scope in which
a prior declaration of that identifier is visible**\***, if the prior
declaration specifies internal or external linkage, the type of the identifier
at the latter declaration becomes the composite type.

\[Footnote \*: As specified in 6.1.2.1, the latter declaration might hide the
prior declaration.]
