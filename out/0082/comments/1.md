### Response

a) All functions listed except for `f3` contain strictly conforming code. The
function `f3` violates the intended requirement for `va_start` and `va_end` to
be invoked in matching pairs, as reflected in the following Correction.

b) There is nothing described in this section that would make such an
implementation non-conforming.

c) No.

### Correction

***In subclause 7.8.1, page 122, change the last sentence from:***

The `va_start` and `va_end` macros shall be invoked in the function accepting a
varying number of arguments, if access to the varying arguments is desired.

***to:***

The `va_start` and `va_end` macros shall be invoked in corresponding pairs in
the function accepting a varying number of arguments, if access to the varying
arguments is desired.

***In subclause 7.8.1.1, page 122, add at the end of the second paragraph of the
Description:***

`va_start` shall not be invoked again for the same `ap` without an intervening
invocation of `va_end` for the same `ap`.
