Proposed Response

A synonym is always acceptable, except that a function definition may not use a
typedef for the function type.

### Response

**Part 1**

Both function declarations are strictly conforming.

Subclause 6.7.1 makes clear that it is a single parameter having the type `void`
(as opposed to use of the `void` keyword) that indicates that a function takes
no parameters.

For clarity, Subclause 6.5.4.3 should be rephrased to emphasize that it is the
type `void`, not the keyword `void`that matters.

### Future Change

In Subclause 6.5.4.3,

Change

> "The special case of `void` as the only item in the list specifies that the
> function has no parameters."

To

> "The special case of an unnamed parameter of type `void` as the only item in the
> list specifies that the function has no parameters."

**Part 2**

Yes, the definition of `main` is strictly conforming.

**Part 3**

A synonym is not acceptable in these cases:

1. A function definition may not use a typedef for the function type:
   > ```c
   > typedef void F(void);
   > extern F g { } /* Invalid */
   > ```
2. A typedef may not be combined with another type specifier:
   > ```c
   > typedef int I;
   >  short I x;     /* Invalid */
   > ```
