Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee agrees that the standard does not specify behavior under these
> conditions and as such there is undefined behavior by way of §7.1.4p1 “If an
> argument to a function has an invalid value … the behavior is undefined”. There
> is strong sentiment to keep the library fast and that imposing new requirements
> to set `errno` is to be generally avoided. Whereas POSIX does define behavior
> that sets `errno` under these conditions, it is explicitly the intent of the
> committee to leave such behavior undefined in the standard to allow such
> refinements by others.

### Proposed Committee Response

> By way of §7.1.4p1 “If an argument to a function has an invalid value … the
> behavior is undefined” the behavior of `strcoll` in the face of invalid input is
> already clearly undefined. The committee wishes to leave it so specified. This
> latitude allows POSIX to further refine the semantics according to their needs.
> We therefore do not accept the Proposed Technical Corrigendum.
