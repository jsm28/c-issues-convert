### Response

The relevant citation is subclause 6.3.9:

> one operand is a pointer to an object or incomplete type and the other is a
> pointer to a qualified or unqualified version of `void`; or

The Committee believes that the current wording of the standard is clear, and it
is not changed in meaning by changing “version of `void`” in the quoted section
to “version of the `void` type.”

The standard uses the word “`void`” in two contexts: the keyword itself and the
type that the keyword names. The context that the word is used in adequately
distinguishes between the two. In the section quoted, which discusses type
compatibility, a misreading of “`void`” as meaning the keyword quickly results
in nonsense.

As to the qualification discussed in the quoted passage, it is type
qualification, defined in subclause 6.5.3. The standard only uses the words
“qualified” and “unqualified” when discussing type qualification and never uses
them when discussing storage classes. Thus, storage classes have no place in the
discussion of the quoted passage.
