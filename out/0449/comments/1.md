### Committee Discussion

* The committee notes that existing practice in all cases has provided a small integer value for this definition.
* Allowing no restrictions is likely to break existing practice.

### Committee Discussion

> The question posed should be answered.

### Proposed Committee Response

> The standard intentionally does not define a value of `TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS` for
> implementations with no maximum.
>
> The `TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS` macro is used to limit recursion at thread
> termination. The issue is that existing practice allows the creation of new
> `tss` bindings during the destructor call, and one destructor might reincarnate
> the original, thus forming an infinite recursive destructor loop. This loop may
> appear non-deterministically and is difficult to detect. The purpose of
> `TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS` is as a bound to such recursion.
>
> It is possible monitor the recursion depth with careful defensive programming
> and in those cases the value of `TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS` is useful as that bound.
