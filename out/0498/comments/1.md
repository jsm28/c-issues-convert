Oct 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The text in §7.1.4 paragraph 5 requires implementations to avoid data races in
> library functions that maintain their internal state. The `mblen`, `mbtowc`, and
> `wctomb` functions are among those that maintain such state. Although the state
> is typically needed only for state-dependent, multibyte encodings, the standard
> doesn't intend to prevent implementations from accessing it for other encodings
> as well. And indeed implementations are known to exist that access the state for
> other encodings as well. Multi-threaded programs that need the functionality
> provided by these functions are intended to make use of the corresponding
> restartable forms of these functions instead (i.e., `mbrlen`, `mbrtowc`, and
> `wcrtomb`, respectively) with a non-null state pointer.

In §7.22.7 paragraph 1 , change:

> Changing the `LC_CTYPE` category causes the conversion state of these functions
> to be indeterminate.

to:

> Changing the `LC_CTYPE` category causes the conversion state of these functions
> to be indeterminate. A call to any one of these functions may introduce a data
> race with a call to any other function in this section.

In §7.29.6.3 paragraph 1 , change:

> The implementation behaves as if no library function calls these functions with
> a null pointer for `ps`.

to:

> The implementation behaves as if no library function calls these functions with
> a null pointer for `ps`. A call to one of these functions with a null `ps`
> pointer may introduce a data race with another call to the same function.

### Committee Discussion

> The committee adopted the words discussed in the previous meeting, with a small
> refinement as suggested in [(SC22WG14.14652) editorial tweak for DR 498
> PTC](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14652).

Apr 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> A new paper [N2246](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2246.htm)
> was not discussed at WG14 and has been postponed until the next meeting.

### Proposed Change

In §7.22.7 paragraph 1 , change:

> Changing the `LC_CTYPE` category causes the conversion state of these functions
> to be indeterminate.

to:

> Changing the `LC_CTYPE` category causes the conversion state of these functions
> to be indeterminate. A call to any one of these functions may introduce a data
> race with a call to any other function in this subclause.

In §7.29.6.3 paragraph 1 , change:

> The implementation behaves as if no library function calls these functions with
> a null pointer for `ps`.

to:

> The implementation behaves as if no library function calls these functions with
> a null pointer for `ps`. A call to one of these functions with a null `ps`
> pointer may introduce a data race with another call to the same function.

Oct 2018 meeting

### Committee Response

> The "C17" edition of the standard has been published as IS 9899:2018.
>
> This issue was not resolved in that publication.
>
> A new paper [N2281](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2281.htm)
> was discussed at some length for possible inclusion in a new edition of the
> standard.
>
> The committee believes that the goal of these papers is to establish a normative
> requirement that calls to `mblen`, `mbtowc`, and `wctomb` be data-race free when
> operating upon state-independent encodings. The committee notes that interleaved
> calls to `setlocale` that change even among non-state-dependent encodings must
> necessarily atomically change a reference to the encoding tables used by these
> functions, and that such change would impede the desired speed advantage sought
> by this change. Any assertion of data-race free must also disallow interleaved
> calls to `setlocale` to maintain the speed advantage.
>
> It was also noted in earlier discussions that some implementations are known to
> use shared state even for non-state dependent encodings.
>
> A new paper is solicited from the author for inclusion in a new edition of the
> standard. An affirmative statement is requested, perhaps along the lines of: The
> total order of `mblen`, `mbtowc`, and `wctomb` shall be data-race free when
> there are no calls to `setlocale` in that order and, proabably, that a
> state-indepenent encoding has been determined by a call to `mblen` in the
> normative manner.
