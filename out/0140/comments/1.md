### Response

As you say, “`setvbuf` is an advisory call and need not be acted on.” That is to
say, the C Standard allows it to fail. Therefore, discussions of detailed
constraints such as you describe could only constitute non-normative advice to
programmers or implementers. The Committee does not have any specific advice to
give in this regard.
