### Committee Discussion

> The suggestion almost works but not quite, as discussed in [(SC22WG14.14632) My

### Committee Discussion

> A short paper was solicited, discussed, and adopted as the Proposed Change to a
> new revision of the Standard.
>
> It was noted that additional wording might be appropriate with regard to both
> tail padding and to address flexible array members.

### Proposed Change

Change ยง6.7.2.1 p13 from:

> An unnamed member of structure type with no tag is called an *anonymous
> structure*; an unnamed member of union type with no tag is called an *anonymous
> union*. The members of an anonymous structure or union are considered to be
> members of the containing structure or union. This applies recursively if the
> containing structure or union is also anonymous.

to:

> An unnamed member of structure type with no tag is called an *anonymous
> structure*; an unnamed member of union type with no tag is called an *anonymous
> union*. The members of an anonymous structure or union are considered to be
> members of the containing structure or union, keeping their structure or union
> layout. This applies recursively if the containing structure or union is also
> anonymous.
