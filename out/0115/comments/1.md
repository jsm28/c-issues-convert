### Response

The Committee agrees that the quoted constraint can be read either way. Hence, a
diagnostic is not required, but a program that uses such a form has undefined
behavior. In the case of an aggregate, the intent was to require a tag or
declarator for the aggregate itself. Thus, it is not unreasonable to issue a
diagnostic for the given example. However, since the constraint can be read
either way, an implementation could actually compile such a case though it is
marginally useful at best.
