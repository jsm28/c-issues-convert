### Response

a) Yes, a diagnostic is required.

b) Yes, this renders the program not strictly conforming.

Note that initialization of an array of character type by a string literal is a
special case, described in subclause 6.5.7.

The phrases “two-dimensional array” and “three-dimensional array” are merely
used for convenience. The **Semantics** section on array declarators (subclause
6.5.4.2) and the syntax specification in the section on declarations (subclause
6.5.4) clearly show that array types must be declared with one index. Thus, an
array which has two indices must be considered an “array of array of type.”

Since this is the case, the **Semantics** description for initializing
aggregates and subaggregates in subclause 6.5.7 applies. This description states

> If the initializer of a subaggregate or the first member of the contained union
> begins with a left brace, the initializers enclosed by that brace and its
> matching right brace initialize the members of the subaggregate or the first
> member of the contained union.

Thus, in the example, the string must be applied only to the first element of
the two-element array (which is an array of 5 characters). Since the initializer
contains 6 characters, it violates the constraint of the same section which
states:

> There shall be no more initializers in an initializer list than there are
> objects to be initialized.
