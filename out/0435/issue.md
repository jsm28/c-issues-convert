### Summary

> The type specifier \_Complex shall not be used if the implementation does not
> support complex types (see 6.10.8.3).

But, G.2 Types, has no similar constraint with respect to \_Imaginary.

### Suggested Technical Corrigendum

Add to G.2 Types, a new sentence in paragraph 1:

> The \_Imaginary type specifier shall not be used if the implementation does not
> support imaginary types (see 6.10.8.3).
