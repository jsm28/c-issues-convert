### Correction

***Add to subclause 6.8.3.3, page 90:***

**Example**

```c
#define hash_hash # ## #
 #define mkstr(a) # a
 #define in_between(a) mkstr(a)
 #define join(c, d) in_between(c hash_hash d)
 char p[] = join(x, y); /* equivalent to char p[] = "x ## y";*/
```

The expansion produces, at various stages:

```c
join(x, y)
 in_between(x hash_hash y)
 in_between(x ## y)
 mkstr(x ## y)
 "x ## y"
```

In other words, expanding `hash_hash` produces a new token, consisting of two
adjacent sharp signs, but this new token is not the catenation operator.
