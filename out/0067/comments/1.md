### Response

a) “Signed integer type”, “unsigned integer type”, and plain “integer type” are
used interchangeably with “signed integral type”, “unsigned integral type”, and
“integral type” in the C Standard. This observation makes it easy to categorize
the types in your list.

b) Yes, see subclause 6.1.2.5.

c) No, the list in the C Standard is meant to be exhaustive. For example,
`float` cannot be defined as an integer type.

d) No strictly conforming program could contain an instance of such a type. The
treatment of such types is beyond the scope of the C Standard.

e) No, it must be a type in the list. For example, `size_t` cannot be defined as
`unsigned __int24`.
