### Response

The relevant citations are the ones supplied by you from subclause 7.10.1.6: If
the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from the
conversion is negated. If the correct value is outside the range of
representable values, `ULONG_MAX` is returned, and the value of the macro
`ERANGE` is stored in `errno`. The Committee believes that there is only one
sensible interpretation of a subject sequence with a minus sign: If the subject
sequence (neglecting the possible minus sign) is outside the range \[0,
`ULONG_MAX`], then the range error is reported. Otherwise, the value is
negated(as an `unsigned long int`). The answers to your numeric questions are:

Case 1: 2,147,483,649

Case 2: 2,147,483,648

Case 3: 2,147,483,647
