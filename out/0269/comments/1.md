### Committee Response

The first bullet point is false; while the second sentence is not a complete
specification, it does not contradict the first sentence.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change 7.18.1.1#3 to read:

> These types are optional. However, if an implementation provides integer types
> with widths of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, no padding bits, and (for the signed
> types) that have a two's complement representation, it shall define the
> corresponding typedef names.

### Committee Discussion

The Committee believes that suggestion 2 (about unsigned types) should be
considered for a future revision of the Standard.
