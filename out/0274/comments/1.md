### Committee Discussion

Our intention is that string and memory copies in the standard library should be
treated as `unsigned char`, similar to 7.21.4.

### Technical Corrigendum

Add a new paragraph 7.21.1#3:

> For all functions in this subclause, each character shall be interpreted as if
> it had the type `unsigned char` (and therefore every possible object
> representation is valid and has a different value).
