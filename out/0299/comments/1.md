### Committee Discussion

7.22p2 says that every function in `<math.h>` and `<complex.h>` without an `l`
or `f` suffix has a corresponding type-generic macro. Except `modf`.

However, 7.22p2 says nothing about what the macro is *called*.

7.22p4 says that if there is a function F() in `<math.h>` and a corresponding
function cF() in `<complex.h>`, then the TG-macro for both F() and cF() is
called "F". In addition, the TG-macro for both `fabs()` and `cabs()` is called
"`fabs`".

7.22p5 and 7.22p6 say that for all remaining functions that have TG-macros, the
macro has the same name as the function.

However, none of 7.22p4 to 7.22p6 say which functions have TG-macros.

Adding "except `cabs`" to 7.22p2 would directly contradict 7.22p4, because it
says that there is *no* TG-macro corresponding to `cabs` (and, therefore,
`fabs`).

If there's a defect in the wording, it's that 7.22p5 should say "except modf"
after "`<math.h>`". Or all of 7.22p4 to 7.22p6 should have something like "Where
a function has a corresponding type-generic macro" inserted in them. But we
don't even believe that is necessary.

To get the absolute value of a `float complex` using a type-generic macro, use
`fabs`. Therefore, 7.22p7 (3rd line from end) needs to change `cabs(fc)` to
`fabs(fc)`.

As G.7p1 correctly shows, to take the absolute value of an imaginary type, use
`fabs`.

### Technical Corrigendum

7.22p5 Add ", except `modf`" after "`<math.h>`"

7.22p7 (3rd line from end), `cabs(fc)` should be changed to `fabs(fc)`.
