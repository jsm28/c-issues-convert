### Response

The declaration

```c
struct s;
```

declares the tag `s`. It need not be the first or only declaration of the tag
`s` within a given scope to qualify as a declaration of `s`, just as

```c
int i;
```

declares `i` however often it is repeated. The applicable constraint is in
subclause 6.5: “A declaration shall declare at least a declarator, a tag, or the
members of an enumeration.” Clearly,

```c
struct s;
```

declares the tag `s`.

Subclause 6.5.2.3, in the examples, characterizes a declaration of this form as
“otherwise vacuous” in the draft you read. The words “otherwise vacuous” were an
editorial comment that was omitted from the International Standard. These words
were intended to mean “other than declaring `s2` to be an (incomplete) struct
type,” and should not be read as saying that the declaration fails to declare
the tag.

We believe that this interpretation is consistent with the intent of the
Committee, and that a reasonable reading of the standard supports this
interpretation.
