### Response

a) [Defect Report #051](issue:0051) provides the rationale for why Line A
results in undefined behavior. The same rules also apply to the assignment to
`pt`; thus Line B results in undefined behavior

b) Not applicable given the answer to question (a).

c) Assignment causes the base address of the structure to be assigned to `pc`.
The response to [Defect Report #044, question 1](issue:0044.01), states that use
of the `offsetof` macro does not result in undefined behavior. The second line
causes `pc` to point to member `data`. Line C does not contain any construct
that would result in the program not being strictly conforming.

d) Line D results in undefined behavior. See answer (a) for rationale.

e) Not applicable given answers (c) and (d).

f) Subclause 6.3 contains additional restrictions, not permissions.

g) The answers to questions (a)-(e) are not affected if `T` has `char` type.
