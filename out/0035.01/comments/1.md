### Response

There is no constraint violation. The scopes of `b`, `x`, and `y` end at the
right-parenthesis at the end of the `enum`, so there is no violation. It is
difficult to *call* the function `f`, but there is no constraint violation. The
phrase “each declarator declares one identifier” in subclause 6.5.4 refers to
`a`, not to `b`, `x`, or `y`.

As an example, in the conforming definition:

```c
void f(a, b)
 int a(enum b{x, y});
 int b;
 {
 }
```

the scope of `b` (the enum tag), `x`, and `y` ends at the right-parenthesis at
the end of the enum (prototype scope).
