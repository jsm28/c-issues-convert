### Response

The scope of `m`, `q`, and `r` ends at the close-brace (block scope). The
operative wording is the more specific statement on page 20, lines 30-31 “...
appears inside a block or within the list of parameter declarations in a
function definition, the identifier has *block scope,* ...”

As an example, in the code fragment:

```c
void g(c)
 enum m{q, r} c;
 {
 }
```

the scope of `m`, `q`, and `r` ends at the closing brace of the function
definition (block scope).
