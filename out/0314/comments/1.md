### Committee Discussion (for history only)

2006-10-25, There was not consensus for the *Proposed Committee Response* listed
below. There was no consensus that question 2 is *undefined behavior*. There
does not seem to be specific words in the Standard that make it undefined
behavior, however that may be what the Committee intended.

#### Spring 2007

See [N1237](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1237.htm).

#### Fall 2007

The Standard doesn't seem to specifically allow the compilation/linking of the
three translations units in question, but is does not seem to disallow it
either.

#### Spring 2008

Current response is good. However, is this is an issue that should be addressed
in C1x? Looked again at N1237 (reviewed in Kona).

* publish an answer that C99 is unspecified/undefined, and we will fix it in C1x
* just come up with a fix for C1x

There is consensus that it should be possible for an implementation to combine
the translation units of a program into a single internal representation and
optimize that, unifying structure and union types across translation units where
required to be compatible in the process.

Normally, it is possible to create a single translation unit equivalent to
multiple translation units, after renaming static variables and functions and
structure and union tags. DR314 question 3 is an example where such renaming is
not possible. My proposal is to add a requirement that it is possible.

It was noted that this has been hanging around for several years. Needs someone
to actually come up with the right words.

### Proposed Committee Response

Question 1: Does 6.2.7#2 refer to the types immediately after the declarations,
or the types at any point where the declarations are in scope?

> Subclause 6.2.7 Paragraph 2 makes a statement about *all* declarations of the
> same object or function, regardless of where the declarations that object or
> function are. It requires that all declarations of the same object or function,
> even if those declarations are in different translation units of the program, to
> have compatible type.  
> Note also that if an object with struct or union type is declared with an
> incomplete type, and that type is later completed in the same scope, the type of
> the declaration is the completed type (Subclause 6.2.5, Paragraph 22). Under
> such conditions, the type of the object or function is the completed type, and
> that type must be compatible with any other declarations.

Question 2: If each of the above three translation units started `extern struct
t *x;`, would there be undefined behavior?

> Yes, undefined behavior.

Question 3: Is an implementation required to accept compiling the three
translation units above together into a program?

> It was never the Committees intention that the standard be interpreted this way.  
> This will be addressed in a future revision of the standard. See WG14 N**xxx**.
