### Committee Discussion

> The committee accepted the Suggested Technical Corrigendum as the Proposed
> Change (using our new terminology).

### Proposed Change

In TS 18661-1, before 14.1, insert:

**14.0 C underflow**

The following change to C11 loosens the C definition of underflow to encompass
IEC 60559 gradual underflow, as is its stated intention (see C11 footnote 232).

**Changes to C11:**

Change the first sentence in 7.12.1#6 from:

> \[6\] The result underflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is so
> small that the mathematical result cannot be represented, without extraordinary
> roundoff error, in an object of the specified type.232) …

to:

> \[6\] The result underflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is
> nonzero and less than the minimum normal number in the type.232) …
