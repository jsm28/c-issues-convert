### Response

The C Standard is clear enough as is. The `longjmp` function shall execute
correctly when called from a non-nested signal handler invoked through calls to
the `raise` or `abort` functions; if `longjmp` is called from a signal handler
invoked by other means, or from a nested signal handler, the behavior is
undefined.
