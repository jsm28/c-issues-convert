### Committee Discussion

> There was considerable discussion on this issue. The first point is that the
> \_Generic example cited that is proposed to be fixed was not intended to impose
> requirements, yet has elicited two fixes so far, this being a third. The second
> point is that the fix offered would likely elicit numerous compiler errors as
> stated and no longer serves its original intention of illustrating \_Generic
> best practice usage. Lastly, lacking a clear simple example, is there a problem
> here that needs clarification becomes uncertain.

### Committee Discussion

> A new document
> [N2212](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2212.pdf) was
> presented with a much simpler proposed change. It was accepted by the committee.

### Proposed Change

In TS 18661-1, clause 16, replace:

```c
       #define cbrt(X) _Generic((X), \
                       long double: cbrtl(X), \
                       default: _Roundwise_cbrt(X), \
                       float: cbrtf(X) \
                       )
```

> where `_Roundwise_cbrt()` is equivalent to `cbrt()` invoked without
> macro-replacement suppression.

with

```c
       #define cbrt(X) _Generic((X), \
                       long double: _Roundwise_cbrtl, \
                       default: _Roundwise_cbrt, \
                       float: _Roundwise_cbrtf \
                       )(X)
```

> where `_Roundwise_cbrtl()`, `_Roundwise_cbrt()`, and `_Roundwise_cbrtf()` are
> equivalent to `cbrtl()`, `cbrt()`, and `cbrtf()`, respectively, invoked without
> macro-replacement suppression.
