> PTC](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14657). From that document the

### Proposed Change

In 7.1.1, add a new paragraph:

> In this clause, references to "white-space character" refer to (execution)
> white-space character as defined by **isspace()**. References to "white-space
> wide character" refer to (execution) white-space wide character as defined by
> **iswspace()**.

Remove '(as specified by the **isspace** function)' in: 7.21.6.2#8 (fscanf),
7.22.1.3#2 (strtod), 7.22.1.4#2 (strtol).

Remove '(as specified by the **iswspace** function)' in: 7.29.2.2#8 (fwscanf),
7.29.4.1.1#2 (wcstod), 7.29.4.1.2#2 (wcstol).

Change "white space" to "white-space characters": 7.21.6.2#15 (fscanf),
7.22.1.4#4 (strtol).

Change "white space" to "white-space wide characters": 7.29.2.2#15 (fwscanf),
7.29.4.1.2#4 (wcstol).

Add "white-space wide character" to the index.
