### Response

If a fully expanded macro replacement list contains a function-like macro name
as its last preprocessing token, it is unspecified whether this macro name may
be subsequently replaced. If the behavior of the program depends upon this
unspecified behavior, then the behavior is undefined.

For example, given the definitions:

```c
#define f(a) a*g
 #define g(a) f(a)
```

the invocation:

```c
f(2)(9)
```

results in undefined behavior. Among the possible behaviors are the generation
of the preprocessing tokens:

```c
2*f(9)
```

and

```c
2*9*g
```

### Correction

***Add to subclause G.2, page 202:***

\- A fully expanded macro replacement list contains a function-like macro name
as its last preprocessing token (6.8.3).
