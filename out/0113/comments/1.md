### Response

a) Yes, a diagnostic is required.

b) Yes, this renders the program not strictly conforming code.

A qualified `void` function return type is disallowed by the constraints of
subclause 6.7.1:

> The return type from a function shall be `void` or an object type other than
> array.

The constraint does not say “a void type” and thus `void` must not be qualified
when used as a function return type. Since a qualified `void` return type is
already invalid, there is no need for the additional constraint on the `return`
statement (subclause 6.6.6.4).
