Oct 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The current text is ambiguous. It might be read to imply that unary operators
> must widen, which is not the intent since it would be incompatible with IEEE
> 60559\. Widening can cause signaling NaNs to be triggered and representations to
> be canonicalized.

### Proposed Change

In 5.2.4.2.2#9, replace:

> Except for assignment and cast (which remove all extra range and precision), the
> values yielded by operators with floating operands and values subject to the
> usual arithmetic conversions and of floating constants are evaluated to a format
> whose range and precision may be greater than required by the type.

with:

> The values of floating type yielded by operators subject to the usual
> arithmetic conversions and the values of floating constants are evaluated to a
> format whose range and precision may be greater than required by the type. In
> all cases, assignment and cast remove all extra range and precision.
