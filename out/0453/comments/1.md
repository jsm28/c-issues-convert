Apr 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee agrees that the use of *true* and *false* are inaccurate.
* The committee does not feel that the proposed words are a sufficient resolution, however, and has solicited a new paper to resolve the issue.

### Committee Discussion

> The paper [N1853](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1853.htm)
> was provided and discussed, revised, discussed further, and a further paper was
> solicited. In particular, the committee did not like "converted to a \_Bool"
> because it implies some unspecified arithmetic conversion.

### Committee Discussion

> The direction developed late at the last meeting is adopted as the Proposed
> Technical Corrigendum.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In 7.17.8.1p2, change:

> Atomically sets the value pointed to by `object` to true.

to:

> Atomically places the atomic flag pointed to by `object` in the set state and
> returns the value corresponding to the immediately preceding state.

In 7.17.8.1p3, change:

> Atomically, the value of the object immediately before the effects.

to:

> The `atomic_flag_test_and_set` functions return the value that corresponds to
> the state of the atomic flag immediately before the effects. The return value
> true corresponds to the set state and the return value false corresponds to the
> clear state.

In 7.17.8.2p2, change:

> Atomically sets the value pointed to by `object` to false.

to:

> Atomically places the atomic flag pointed to by `object` into the clear state.
