### Response

In the first function called `example`, the expression statement `&*pv` is dealt
with in [Defect Report #012](issue:0012). The remaining three statements are
well formed. See the last sentence of the cited reference and also subclause
6.6.3.

In the second function called `example`, the expression statements `&*pcv` and
`&*pvv` are dealt with in [Defect Report #012](issue:0012). The remaining six
statements are well formed. The restrictions given in subclause 6.5.3 apply to
object types, not incomplete types.
