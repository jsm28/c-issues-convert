Apr 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee agrees with the assessment and the suggested changes.
* There are, however, other places where similar changes are needed.

Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* Further investigation confirmed that there were several other functions that also need similar corrections to their runtime constraints. All of these additional functions also need additional corrections as specified in [DR433,](issue:0433) and the full resolution of both this defect and the additional issue will be found in the Proposed Technical Corrigendum of [DR433.](issue:0433)
* That list is:
  + K.3.9.1.3 The snwprintf\_s function
  + K.3.9.1.4 The swprintf\_s function
  + K.3.9.1.8 The vsnwprintf\_s function
  + K.3.9.1.9 The vswprintf\_s function
  + K.3.9.3.2.1 The mbsrtowcs\_s function
  + K.3.9.3.2.2 The wcsrtombs\_s function
* It is noted that with these changes that K.3.5.1.2 `tmpname_s` will have wording inconsistent with respect to these modifications.
* Consistent wording would be, in K.3.5.1.2p2 replace "less than or equal to RSIZE\_MAX" with "not greater than RSIZE\_MAX".
* As such, the committee continues to accept unchanged the Proposed Technical Corrigendum as partial fulfillment of this defect, and that full resolution of the other similar defects will be found in [DR433.](issue:0433)

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

snprintf\_s  
Replace K.3.5.3.5p3 with:  

If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if s is not a null   pointer
and n is greater than zero and not greater than RSIZE\_MAX, then the  
snprintf\_s function sets s\[0\] to the null character.

sprintf\_s  
Replace K.3.5.3.6p3 with:  

If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if s is not a null pointer and
n is greater than zero and not greater than RSIZE\_MAX, then the sprintf\_s
function sets s\[0\] to the null character.

vsnprintf\_s  
Replace K.3.5.3.12p3 with:  

If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if s is not a null pointer and
n is greater than zero and not greater than RSIZE\_MAX, then the   vsnprintf\_s
function sets s\[0\] to the null character.

vsprintf\_s  
Replace K.3.5.3.13p3 with:  

If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if s is not a null   pointer
and n is greater than zero and not greater than RSIZE\_MAX, then the  
vsprintf\_s function sets s\[0\] to the null character.
