### Committee Response

In addition to the following Technical Corrigendum, add to the Rationale section
that discusses 5.2.4.2.2 of the C Standard:

> The committee has been made aware of at least one implementation (VAX and Alpha
> in VAX mode) whose floating-point format does not support signed zeros. The
> hardware representation that one thinks would represent -0.0 is in fact treated
> as a non-numeric value similar to a NaN. Therefore, `copysign(+0.0,-1.0)`
> returns \+0.0, not the expected -0.0, on this implementation. Some places that
> mention (or might have) signed zero results and the sign might be different than
> you expect:
>
> The complex functions, in particular with branch cuts;
>
> > ```c
> > ceil()
> > conj()
> > copysign()
> > fmod()
> > modf()
> > fprintf() (Footnote 233 is OK)fwprintf() (Footnote 273 is OK)nearbyint()
> > nextafter()
> > nexttoward()
> > remainder() (Footnote 201 does not need to be changed)remquo()
> > rint()
> > round()
> > signbit()
> > strtod() (Footnote 249 is OK)trunc()
> > wcstod() (Footnote 285 is OK)
> > ```
>
> Underflow: In particular: `ldexp()`, `scalbn()`, `scalbln()`.

### Technical Corrigendum

Add a new paragraph to 5.2.4.2.2, after \[#3]:

> \[#3a] An implementation may give zero and non-numeric values (such as
> infinities and NaNs) a sign or may leave them unsigned. Wherever such values are
> unsigned, any requirement in this International Standard to retrieve the sign
> shall produce an unspecified sign, and any requirement to set the sign shall be
> ignored.
