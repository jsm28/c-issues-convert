### Committee Discussion

Integer conversion rank does not address `enums` that rank equal to `int`.

The words "or equal to" should be added, but there is another issue regarding
`enum` and whether or not it can ever be greater in rank than `int` (or
`unsigned int`) since the *constant-expressions* for the initializers are
constrained to the range of values that may be expressed by an `int`. The words
of the simple proposed change are good. The more general proposal doesn't seem
to fix anything else.

### Technical Corrigendum

In 6.3.1.1 paragraph 2, change the first bullet to:

> An object or expression with an integer type whose integer conversion rank is
> less than or equal to the rank of `int` and `unsigned int`.
