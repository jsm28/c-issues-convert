Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The premise of this DR is essentially that the original specification of `volatile` did not accurately reflect the intent at the time of its formulation and that ongoing practice has in fact implemented the intent. On the basis that the intent was clearly established and that practice corroborates it, the committee accepted this as a defect and moreover concluded that it is in substantial agreement.
* Although asked, the committee did not spend any time answering the question as to why such a defect had never before been reported. All implementors represented on the committee were polled and all confirmed that indeed, the intent, not the standard, is implemented. In addition to the linux experience documented in the paper, at least two committee members described discussions with systems engineers where this difference between the standard vs the implementation was discussed because the systems engineers clearly depended on the implementation of actual intent. The sense was that this was simply a well known discrepency.
* Specifically, the intent is reflected in the implementations of the gcc, Intel, clang, sparc, and IBM compilers. Although far from a complete enumeration of C compilers, these were broad enough to accept that all known compilers that the committee could speak to that are used for systems implementation in fact implement the intent, not the standard.
* The committee also believes that C\+\+ “got this (nearly) right” and that there will likely be a liaison issue on this topic.
* The committee feels that the changes proposed to 5.1.2.3p6 bullet 1 are the “heart of the matter”. There was a suggestion that editorially, it might be worthwhile to define a new term *volatile access* at that point and use it consistently in the other parts of the standard rather than as proposed in the suggested technical corrigendum. This suggestion and other comments can also be found in [(SC22WG14.13870) N1956 volatile semantics](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13870). This rephrasing of the proposed changes could eliminate potential confusion when introduced elsewhere.
* The author was asked to revise his wordings through soliciting input either directly from committee members or indirectly through the use of the WG14 reflector and to formulate and submit a new paper on this topic.

### Committee Discussion

> Further correspondence with the author led to a small paper containing a revised
> Suggested Technical Corrigendum incorporating the suggestion from the last
> meeting. The following proposed changes were considered appropriate.
>
> Change §5.1.2.3p2 from:
>
> > Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file, or calling a
> > function that does any of those operations are all side effects ...
>
> to:
>
> > An access to an object through the use of an lvalue of volatile-qualified type
> > is a *volatile access*. A volatile access to an object, modifying a file, or
> > calling a function that does any of those operations are all side effects ...
>
> Change §5.1.2.3p4 from:
>
> > An actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can
> > deduce that its value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced
> > (including any caused by calling a function or accessing a volatile object.
>
> to:

> Change §5.1.2.3p6 bullet 1 from:

> There was a suggestion that *volatile access* be reconciled with the definition
> of *lvalue* in §6.3.2.1 and that further wording is solicited.

### Committee Discussion

> The committee agreed to adopt the wording worked out in prior meetings, and to
> leave the definition of *lvalue* unchanged at this time.

### Proposed Change

Change §5.1.2.3p2 from:

> Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file, or calling a
> function that does any of those operations are all side effects ...

to:

> An access to an object through the use of an lvalue of volatile-qualified type
> is a *volatile access*. A volatile access to an object, modifying a file, or
> calling a function that does any of those operations are all side effects ...

Change §5.1.2.3p4 from:

> An actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can
> deduce that its value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced
> (including any caused by calling a function or accessing a volatile object.

to:

> An actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can
> deduce that its value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced
> (including any caused by calling a function or through volatile access to an
> object.

Change §5.1.2.3p6 bullet 1 from:

> Accesses to volatile objects are evaluated strictly according to the rules of
> the abstract machine.

to:

> Volatile accesses to objects are evaluated strictly according to the rules of
> the abstract machine.
