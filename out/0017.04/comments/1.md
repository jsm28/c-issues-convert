### Response

The values of octal or hexadecimal escape sequences are well defined and not
mapped. For instance, the value of the constant `'\x12'` is always 18, while the
value of the constant `'\34'` is always 28\.

The mapping described in subclause 6.1.3.4 on page 28, lines 35-39 only applies
to members of the source character set, of which octal and hexadecimal escape
sequences clearly are not members.
