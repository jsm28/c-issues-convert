### Response

`case INT_MAX + 2:` is a constraint violation.

`case INT_MAX + 2ul:` is okay, representable.

`case (INT_MAX*4)/4:` is a constraint violation.

When subclause 6.4 says on page 55, lines 11-12:

> Each constant expression shall evaluate to a constant that is in the range of
> representable values for its type.

the Committee's judgement of the intent is that the “representable” requirement
applies to each subexpression of a constant expression, as shown in the third
example. A constant expression is meant as defined by the syntax rules.

`enum {a=INT_MAX, b};` is a constraint violation.
