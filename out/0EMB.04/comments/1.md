Problem: The type-generic macro definition sections (4.1.7.6 and 7.18a.6.7) are
incomplete and possibly wrong (see N1071 for more information)

Solution: The generic function names should be 'absfx', 'countlsfx' and
'roundfx'; 7.18a.6.7 should better explain which underlying functions are
selected.

Changes: in the replacement text for 7.18a.6.7:

* Change the type font for 'fx' from bold italic to bold (3 times)
* Add to 7.18a.6.7:
  > For each macro, use of the macro invokes the function whose corresponding real
  > type and type domain is the real type of the first generic argument. If the real
  > type of the first generic argument is not a fixed-point type, the behavior is
  > undefined.
