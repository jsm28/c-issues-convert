### Committee Discussion

> * Blaine Garst and the submitter worked on this between meetings, they believe this is not a problem.
> * Convener prefers this remain OPEN for now, there could be additional text as discussed in Oct.
> * C11 does define the semantics of a lock within a single thread.

Oct 2012 meeting

### Proposed Committee Response

> * The expression `(x = 1)==(x = 2)` has undefined behavior in C11.
> * The happens-before relationship imposed by `(lock(), x = 1, unlock())` does not constrain the possible interwoven order of evaluation of `(lock(), x = 2, unlock())` .
