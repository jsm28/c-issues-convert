### Committee Discussion

The element types are composed. Suggested TC is close, but not quite right. The
example from 11145 should be included here.

Also see [N1238](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1238.htm) and
WG14 e-mail SC22WG14.11145.

#### Fall 2007

No consensus was reached on the words from
[N1238](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1238.htm).

#### Spring 2008

It appears that the current implementations differ in this area. Some compilers
works one way (as described), while others do not. Probably best solution is to
make this undefined behavior.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In subclause 6.2.7, paragraph 3, change the first bullet to the following.

> – If both types are array types, the following rules are applied:
>
> > If one type is an array of known constant size, the composite type is an array
> > of that size.  
> > Otherwise, if one type is a variable length array whose size is specified by an
> > expression that is not evaluated, the behavior is undefined.  
> > Otherwise, if one type is a variable length array whose size is specified, the
> > composite type is a variable length array of that size.  
> > Otherwise, if one type is a variable length array of unspecified size, the
> > composite type is a variable length array of unspecified size.  
> > Otherwise, both types are arrays of unknown size, and the composite type is an
> > array of unknown size.  
> > The element type of the composite type is the composite type of the two element
> > types.
>
> In subclause J.2, paragraph 1, insert the following bullet in order.
>
> > – A program requires the formation of a composite type from a variable length
> > array type whose size is specified by an expression that is not evaluated
> > (6.2.7).
