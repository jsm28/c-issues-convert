### Response

Length is determined by “various methods.” For strings in which all elements are
accessed, length is inferred by null-byte termination. For `mbstowcs`,
`wcstombs`, `strftime`, `vsprintf`, `sscanf`, `sprintf` and all other similar
functions, it was the intent of the C Standard that the rules in subclause
7.11.1 be applicable by extension (i.e., the objects and lengths are similarly
dynamically determined). The behavior (in Examples 4 and 5\) is defined.
