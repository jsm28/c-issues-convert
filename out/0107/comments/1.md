### Response

a) The definition of `assert` depends on the `NDEBUG` macro. The **Synopsis**
provides information on how an implementation may use the parameter. If `NDEBUG`
is defined as a macro, the parameter is not used and hence cannot cause
undefined behavior. If `NDEBUG` is not defined as a macro, the implementation
may rely on the parameter having type `int`. Passing a non-`int` argument in
such a context will render the translation unit not strictly conforming.

b) If `NDEBUG` is defined as a macro, the parameter is not used and no
diagnostic should occur. Otherwise, a violation of this requirement results in
undefined behavior, which does not require a diagnostic.

c) No.
