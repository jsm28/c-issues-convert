### Response

A typedef of an incomplete type is permitted.

Regarding objects `one` and `two`, refer to the standard subclause 6.1.2.5, page
24, lines 8-9: “An array of unknown size is an incomplete type. It is completed,
*for an identifier of that type,* by specifying the size in a later declaration
...” \[emphasis added\]. The types of objects `one` and `two` are completed but
the type `table` itself is *never* completed. Hence, `sizeof(table)` is not
permitted.

An example very similar to that submitted is shown in example 6, subclause 6.5.7
on page 74, lines 16-23.
