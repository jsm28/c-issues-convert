Principles for C floating-point representation:

(These principles are intended to clarify the use of some terms in the standard;
they are not meant to impose additional constraints on conforming
implementations.)

1. “Value” refers to the abstract (mathematical) meaning; “representation” refers to the implementation data pattern.
2. Some (not all) values have exact representations.
3. There may be multiple exact representations for the same value; all such representations shall compare equal.
4. Exact representations of different values shall compare unequal.
5. There shall be at least one exact representation for the value zero.
6. Implementations are allowed considerable latitude in the way they represent floating-point quantities; in particular, as noted in Footnote 10 on page 14, the implementation need not exactly conform to the model given in subclause 5.2.4.2.2 for “normalized floating-point numbers.”
7. There may be minimum and/or maximum exactly-representable values; all values between and including such extrema are considered to “lie within the range of representable values.”
8. Implementations may elect to represent “infinite” values, in which case all real numbers would lie within the range of representable values.
9. For a given value, the “nearest representable value” is that exactly-representable value within the range of representable values that is closest (mathematically, using the usual Euclidean norm) to the given value.

(Points 3 and 4 are meant to apply to representations of the same floating type,
not meant for comparison between different types.)

This implies that a conforming implementation is allowed to accept a
floating-point constant of any arbitrarily large or small value.
