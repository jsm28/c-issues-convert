### Response

Subclause 6.1.2.5 does clearly state, “An *array type* describes a contiguously
allocated nonempty set of objects with a particular member object type, called
the *element type.***17**” Footnote 17 and the first paragraph of subclause
6.1.2.5 both state that object types do not include incomplete types. Nor do
object types include function types. Thus, the array element type must not be
any of the items you have listed. A diagnostic is not required. The Committee
believes that whether or not a diagnostic is produced is an issue of quality of
implementation.
