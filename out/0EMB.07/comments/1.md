Problem: The description of the fixed-point rounding functions in the
replacement text for 7.18a.6.3 require that fractional bits beyond the rounding
point are set to zero in the result. This should not apply when saturation has
occurred.

Solution: Replace the text as proposed.

Change: Modify the third sentence of the description of 7.18a.6.3 to read: 'When
saturation has not occurred, fractional bits beyond the rounding point are set
to zero in the result.'
