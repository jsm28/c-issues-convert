### Committee Discussion

These look like new requirements on the math functions (they are not). They
might break an existing implementation (possible). Therefore, only add these to
annex F.

The above material for the rationale, which should be used, should merge the
last two paragraphs.

#### Fall 2007

It was noted that there is no rounding requirements for some of the cases
mentioned

#### Spring 2008

We believe that the proposed TC is correct, and nobody has found any additional
rounding requirements.

### Technical Corrigendum

In section 7.12.10.2, remove the sentence "Thus, the remainder is always exact."
in footnote 204 in C99\+TC1\+TC2.

F.9.3.4 The `frexp` functions add the following sentence:

> When the radix of the argument is a power of 2, the returned value is exact and
> is independent of the current rounding direction mode.

F.9.3.5 The `ilogb` functions, add the following sentence:

> When the returned value is representable in the range of the return type, the
> returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.3.11 The `logb` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.3.12 The `modf` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned values are exact and are independent of the current rounding
> direction mode.

F.9.4.2 The `fabs` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.4.5 The `sqrt` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is dependent on the current rounding direction mode.

F.9.6.1 The `ceil` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.6.2 The `floor` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.6.8 The `trunc` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.7.1 The `fmod` functions, add the following sentence:

> When subnormal results are supported, the returned value is exact and is
> independent of the current rounding direction mode.

F.9.7.2 The `remainder` functions, add the following sentence:

> When subnormal results are supported, the returned value is exact and is
> independent of the current rounding direction mode.

F.9.7.3 The `remquo` functions, add the following sentence:

> When subnormal results are supported, the returned value is exact and is
> independent of the current rounding direction mode.

F.9.8.1 The `copysign` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.8.2 The `nan` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.8.3 The `nextafter` functions, add the following sentence:

> Even though underflow or overflow can occur, the returned value is independent
> of the current rounding direction mode.

F.9.8.4 The `nexttoward` functions, add the following sentence:

> Even though underflow or overflow can occur, the returned value is independent
> of the current rounding direction mode.

F.9.9.2 The `fmax` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.

F.9.9.3 The `fmin` functions, add the following sentence:

> The returned value is exact and is independent of the current rounding direction
> mode.
