### Committee Discussion

> * `ATOMIC_VAR_INIT` is required to initialize an atomic object to a known value.
> * The default value for an atomic object is defined to be valid but is unspecified.
> * The committee does not see this as a defect.
> * N1649 proposes that the default value be specified to be the same as the non-atomic typeâ€™s default value.
> * Such a proposal should be submitted as such and may also need to be submitted to and addressed by WG21 (C\+\+) as well.

### Proposed Committee Response

`ATOMIC_VAR_INIT` is required to initialize an atomic object to a known value.
This value is defined to be valid but is unspecified in order to support the
widest possible set of architectures. This is not a defect.
