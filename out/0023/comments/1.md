### Response

According to our response to [Defect Report #025, Question 1](issue:0025), the
result of `strtod("0.0e99999", &ptr)` is exactly representable, i.e., it lies
within the range of representable values. Therefore, by subclause 7.10.1.4,
**Returns**, the value zero shall be returned in this case, and `errno` shall
not be set. (This means that implementations have to test for the special case
of zero when creating floating-point representations from characters.)

Note also that `strtod("0.0e-99999", &ptr)` is not a case of underflow, so
`errno` shall not be set to `ERANGE` in this case either.
