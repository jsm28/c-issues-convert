Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* This paper elicited a long and productive discussion. The committee agrees with the author of the `_Generic` proposal that the intent was that selecting on qualified types was explicitly to be avoided as was selecting on arrays by size. The intent of `_Generic` was to give C a mechanism to somewhat express the notion of “overloaded function” found in C\+\+, and in particular a possible mechanism for implementors to use to implement the atomic type generic functions from section 7.17.7. Although this sentiment is most closely reflected in Choice 1 above, and it is reported that clang has also now adopted that approach, the committee feels that the wording in the Suggested Technical Corrigendum is not appropriate.
* The sentiment of the committee is to state that the type of arrays should decay into pointers in the controlling expression of a `_Generic` primary expression.
* The sentiment of the committee is that a better approach to the lvalue conversion issue is to revise 6.5.1.1p2 by adding something along the lines of
  > The type of the controlling expression of a generic selection is the unqualified
  > type determined by applying the lvalue conversions described in 6.3.2.1p2 as if
  > by evaluation.
* The author is requested to incorporate this feedback into a new proposal and is encouraged to solicit input directly from committee members and on the WG14 reflector.

### Committee Discussion

> It was noted that bitfields are of integer type.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In §6.5.1.1p2 change:

> The controlling expression of a generic selection shall have type compatible
> with at most one of the types named in its generic association list.

to

> The type of the controlling expression is the type of the expression as if it
> had undergone an lvalue conversion<sup>new</sup>, array to pointer conversion,
> or function to pointer conversion. That type shall be compatible with at most
> one of the types named in the generic association list.
>
> <sup>new)</sup>lvalue conversion drops type qualifiers.
