### Committee Discussion (for history only)

The committee wishes to keep the term "type category" for now, removing the term
"type category" from the next revision of the standard should be considered at
that time. The text of footnote 93 does use the term incorrectly, but the
wording can be changed to use the term correctly \- and the parenthetical
example provided in the DR can also be incorporated to make the intent even
clearer.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change footnote 93\.

> "...which removes any type qualifiers that were applied to the type category of
> the expression (for example, it removes `const` but not `volatile` from the type
> `int volatile * const`)."
