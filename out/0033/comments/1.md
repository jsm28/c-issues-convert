### Response

Concerning a violation of subclause 6.5.2.1, **Semantics**, page 60, line 30: No
diagnostic is required; this is undefined behavior. It is not a violation of a
constraint or syntax.

Concerning a violation of clause 3, page 2, lines 2-3, No diagnostic is
required.

Suggested Interpretation #2 is the correct one.

Conformance to FIPS is beyond the scope of WG14. We can't comment on this.
