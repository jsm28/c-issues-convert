### Response

Subclause 6.7.2 **External object definitions** contains the following excerpt:

> If a translation unit contains one or more tentative definitions for an
> identifier, and the translation unit contains no external definition for that
> identifier, then the behavior is exactly as if the translation unit contains a
> file scope declaration of that identifier, with the composite type as of the end
> of the translation unit, with an initializer equal to 0\.

This statement describes an effect and not a literal token sequence. Therefore,
this example does not contain an error.
