### Correction

***Add to subclause 6.3.16.1, page 54, another Example:***

In the fragment:

```c
   char c;
    int i;
    long l;

    l = ( c = i );
```

the value of `i` is converted to the type of the assignment-expression `c = i`,
that is, `char` type. The value of the expression enclosed in parenthesis is
then converted to the type of the outer assignment-expression, that is, `long`
type.
