Oct 2012 meeting

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

7.17.1 add a new paragraph after paragraph 5:

> It is unspecified whether any generic function declared in `stdatomic.h` is a
> macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is
> suppressed in order to access an actual function, or a program defines an
> external identifier with the name of a generic function, the behavior is
> undefined.

J.2 add:

> The macro definition of a generic function is suppressed in order to access an
> actual function (7.17.1)
