### Proposed Committee Response

> The **ATOMIC\_VAR\_INIT** macro prepares an atomic value that includes any extra
> state necessary for a non-lock-free type. Initialization, by definition, ignores
> all previous state. Assignment must honor the extra state that would indicate
> another atomic operation in progress; such an assignment takes the non-atomic
> corresponding value resulting from removing all qualifiers including atomic from
> the value expression, and will manipulate the extra state held in the object to
> assure proper atomic assignment semantics. **ATOMIC\_VAR\_INIT** produces a
> value appropriate for initialization because it will have any necessary extra
> state, whereas a value suitable for assignment is the non-qualified version of
> the assignment expression.
> 
> All uses of **ATOMIC\_VAR\_INIT** other than for initialization result in
> implicitly undefined behavior.
