### Committee Discussion

Flags are not objects, thus the constraint on modifying objects doesn't apply to
flags.

### Committee Response

As noted in the response to [DR 087](issue:0087), function calls in the same
expression do not overlap. This has not changed for C99.

### Technical Corrigendum

Add a footnote to 6.5 Expressions, paragraph 2, after the first sentence.

> <sup>\*</sup>A floating-point status flag is not an object and can be set more
> than once within an expression.

Add a footnote to 7.6 Floating-point environment, paragraph 1, after the third
sentence.

> <sup>\*</sup>A floating-point status flag is not an object and can be set more
> than once within an expression.
