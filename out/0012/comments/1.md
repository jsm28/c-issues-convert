### Response

The relevant citations are subclause 6.3.3.2 (page 43, lines 36-38):

> The operand of the unary `&` operator shall be either a function designator or
> an lvalue that designates an object that is not a bit-field and is not declared
> with the `register` storage-class specifier.

and the one supplied by you from subclause 6.2.2.1 (page 36, lines 3-4):

> An *lvalue* is an expression (with an object type or an incomplete type other
> than `void`) that designates an object.

Given the following declaration:

```c
void *p;
```

the expression `&*p` is invalid. This is because `*p` is of type `void` and so
is not an lvalue, as discussed in the quote from subclause 6.2.2.1 above.
Therefore, as discussed in the quote from subclause 6.3.3.2 above, the operand
of the `&` operator in the expression `&*p` is invalid because it is neither a
function designator nor an lvalue.

This is a constraint violation and the translator must issue a diagnostic
message.

The desired effect can be obtained by using the declaration

```c
extern const void end;
```

(where `end` denotes an object of unknown size) since `const void` type is not
`void` type and thus `&end` does not violate the constraint in subclause
6.3.3.2.

Footnote 6 (page 6), which is not part of the standard, provides a suggestion
for implementors who may wish to assign a meaning to the above expression. It
says “(An implementation) may also successfully translate an invalid program.”
Therefore, as long as a diagnostic message is issued, a translator may assign a
meaning to the expression `&*p` discussed above. Conforming programs shall not
use this expression, however.
