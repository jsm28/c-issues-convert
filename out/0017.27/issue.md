`g` conversions

Subclause 7.9.6.1 says on page 132, lines 42: “For `g` and `G` conversions,
trailing zeros will *not* be removed ...,” whereas on page 133, lines 37-38 it
says: “Trailing zeros are removed ...”

It has been suggested that the italics on page 132, lines 42 gives this rule
precedence. I don't mind which rule wins as long as the text says so. Do we add
text to describe the italics rule or change the conflicting lines?
