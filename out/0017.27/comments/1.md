### Response

In the collision between the description of the `#` flag and the `g` and `G`
conversion specifiers to `fprintf,` which takes precedence?

The `#` flag takes precedence. Subclause 7.9.6.1, page 132, line 1 says, “Zero
or more *flags* (in any order) ... modify the meaning of the conversion
specification.”
