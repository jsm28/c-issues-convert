> was provided and discussed, and after several revisions the following proposal

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Change K.3.5.1.2 paragraph 8 (the Returns section of `tmpnam_s`) from:

> If no suitable string can be generated, or if there is a runtime-constraint
> violation, the `tmpnam_s` function writes a null character to `s[0]` (only if
> `s` is not null and `maxsize` is greater than zero) and returns a nonzero value.

to:

> If no suitable string can be generated, or if there is a runtime-constraint
> violation, the `tmpnam_s` function:
> 
> * if `s` is not null and `maxsize` is both greater than zero and not greater than `RSIZE_MAX`, writes a null character to `s[0]`
> * returns a nonzero value.
