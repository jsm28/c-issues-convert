Apr 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The proposed change seems appropriate and is consistent with the existing rationale.
* The committee notes that some implementations may need to change to avoid treating a value of zero for **maxsize** as a constraint violation.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Replace Annex K.3.6.2.1p2 second sentence with:  

**maxsize** shall not be greater than **RSIZE\_MAX**.  

K.3.6.2.1p2 would then read thusly:  

**name** shall not be a null pointer.  **maxsize** shall not be greater than  
**RSIZE\_MAX**.  If **maxsize** is not equal to zero, then **value** shall not
be a null pointer.
