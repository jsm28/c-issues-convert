Oct 2013 meeting

> The committee adopted a Proposed Committee Response that has been substantially
> revised.

Oct 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The Proposed Committee Response was revised for accuracy and more detailed
> information, and is provided below.

**Proposed Committee Response (obsolete)**

> The committee regards the existing definition of `FLT_ROUNDS` as intended to
> apply to types `float`, `double` and `long double`. However, if all three types
> cannot support the same set of rounding modes, the implementation needs to set
> `FLT_ROUNDS` to -1 meaning indeterminable.
> 
> As has been pointed out, in Annex F, only the types float and double need be IEC
> 60559 types. If long double is not an IEC 60559 type (for example, a pair of
> doubles), it may not support the same set of rounding modes as float and double.
> In this case, having `FLT_ROUNDS` apply to float and double (but not long
> double) would result in a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3 and would provide new and
> useful information to the programmer.
> 
> However, this behavioral change could also break existing programs, and as such
> the committee prefers to leave as is for this revision of the Standard.

Apr 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The Proposed Committee Response was revised yet again based on the input that
> since FLT\_ROUNDS in existing practice is universally coded as 1, the proposed
> changes wonâ€™t affect existing practice.

### Proposed Committee Response

> The implementation of `long double`, for example, may significantly differ from
> IEC floating types and may not support the same choices as would otherwise be
> possible for `FLT_ROUNDS`. All known implementations define `FLT_ROUNDS` as the
> value `1` (round to nearest). and as such exempting non-IEC `long double`
> behavior allows the potential for implementations to provide the full range of
> possible values for IEC floating types.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

At the end of F.2#1, insert

> The value of FLT\_ROUNDS applies to all IEC 60559 types supported by the
> implementation, but need not apply to non-IEC 60559 types.
