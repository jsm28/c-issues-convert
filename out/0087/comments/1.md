### Response

In line B, the expression does not exhibit undefined behavior, but because the
order of evaluation of the operands of the addition operator is not specified
and function calls do not overlap, it is unspecified whether `g` will attain the
value 1 or 2\. Lines C and A violate the quoted restriction from subclause 6.3,
so the behavior is undefined.
