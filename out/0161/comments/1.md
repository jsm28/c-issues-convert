Yes, the term "any combination" does include the empty combination so names such
as those cited are reserved. We believe that having the "any combination"
language in parenthetical remarks rather than as part of the main text makes is
sufficiently clear that it is just the prefix that is important in determining
whether a name is reserved or not.
