### Committee Discussion (for history only)

The proposed resolution invalidates code that strictly conforms to the C99
standard. Here is a contrived example (though there are some examples that are
not contrived):

```c
   #include <time.h>
   #include <stdio.h>

   struct tm tm;

   int
   main (void)
   {
     tm.tm_wday = 0;
     tm.tm_mon = 0;
     tm.tm_mday = -99;
     tm.tm_hour = 99;
     tm.tm_min = 99;
     tm.tm_sec = 99;
     tm.tm_year = -999 - 1900;
     printf ("%s\n", asctime (&tm));
     return 0;
   }
```

This code strictly conforms to C99, with well-defined behavior, and some
implementations prints "Sun Jan-99 99:99:99 -999". The proposed resolution
places extra constraints on asctime's arguments that would cause the above code
to have undefined behavior.

The original interpretation request considered by the Austin Group contained an
additional requirement, that the calculated year should not precede the Epoch
(the date and time associated with `(time_t)0)`. This restriction was removed in
forwarding this to the C committee, since there is no C equivalent concept.
However, if the calculated year is less than 1000, problems may occur, so
perhaps the wording should be:

> If the calculated year is less than 1000 or greater than 9999, the behavior is
> undefined.

**Note:** This appears to be a duplicate of [DR 217](issue:0217), which advises
no consensus / no change.

It was also pointed out that the Proposed Technical Corrigendum does not fix all
of the issues, such as if `tm_mon=4` and `tm_mday=31`, both valid numbers, but
not a valid date.

### Technical Corrigendum

Add after the example code, and before the "Returns" section, the following new
paragraph:

> If any of the fields of the `tm` structure pointed to by `timeptr` contain
> values that are outside the normal ranges\*, the behavior of `asctime()` is
> undefined. If the calculated year exceeds four digits, or is less than the year
> 1000, the behavior is undefined.

Add footnote \*:

> See 7.23.1 para 4 for the specifications of the "normal ranges".
