Problem: The new text for 6.7.2.1, requires that a specifier-qualifier-list in
the declaration of a member of a structure or union shall not include an address
space qualifier. This disallows for instance the type of a member of structure
to be a pointer into a named address space.

Solution: The intention was to disallow members of a single structure/union to
have different address qualifiers.

Change: Modify the constraint for 6.7.2.1 to be: 'Within a structure or union
specifier, the type of a member shall not be qualified by an address space
qualifier.'
