Oct 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee discussed the Proposed Technical Corrigendum from
> [N1842](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1842.htm) and found
> that it didn't sufficiently clarify the issue. Investigation during the meeting
> revealed that several (in fact all that were tested) compilers did not seem to
> follow the interpretation of the standard as given in N1842, and that it would
> be best to acknowledge this as unspecified behavior.

### Proposed Committee Response

> 6.10.4 paragraph 2 states that “The *line number* of the current source line is
> one greater than the number of new-line characters read or introduced in
> translation phase 1 (5.1.1.2) while processing the source file to the current
> token.” Note that it does not say the number of new-line characters that exist
> prior to the current token; it says the number of new-line characters that have
> been read while processing to the current token.
> 
> In the case of the `#line` directive of the form
> 
> `#line` *pp-tokens new-line*
> 
> there are two possible values for the number of new-line characters that have
> been read when processing begins on the first *pp-token*. In a one-pass
> preprocessor, the line number at the first *pp-token* will be the number of
> new-line characters that exist prior to the `#line` directive, because that
> number of new-lines will have been read. In a preprocessor that must see the
> entire directive before processing it, since the directive explicitly includes a
> new-line, the line number at the first *pp-token* will be the number of new-line
> characters that exist prior to the `#line` directive plus one.
> 
> Therefore, in a `#line` directive of the form
> 
> ```c
> #line __LINE__ “filename”
> ```
> 
> there are two possible values for `__LINE__`, which leads to two possible values
> for the line number following the `#line` directive. Both are valid.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Add the following footnote to the end of 6.10.4 paragraph 5\.

> Because a new-line is explicitly included as part of the `#line` directive, the
> number of new-line characters read while processing to the first *pp-token* may
> be different depending on whether or not the implementation uses a one-pass
> preprocessor. Therefore, there are two possible values for the line number
> following a directive of the form `#line __LINE__ new-line`.

Add the following to J.1 Unspecified behavior.

> The line number following a directive of the form `#line __LINE__ new-line`
> (6.10.4).
