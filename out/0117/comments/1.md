### Response

The C Standard does not forbid an implementation from interleaving the
subexpressions in the given example as specified above. Similarly, there is no
requirement that an implementation use this particular interleaving. It is
irrelevant that one particular interleaving yields code that properly delimits
multiple modifications of the same object with sequence points. Any program that
depends on this particular interleaving is depending on unspecified behavior,
and is therefore not strictly conforming.
