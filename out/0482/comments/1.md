Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee was unsympathetic to the Suggested Technical Corrigendum. It was
> noted that function invocations are allowed to span files and that there are
> some implementations that do support macro invocations that the Suggested
> Technical Corrigendum would invalidate.
> 
> The committee agrees that such uses should probably have been prohibited in the
> original specification and may consider adding such restrictions in a possible
> future revision of the Standard, and will record this intent in the next
> revision of WG 14 Standing Document 3 currently at
> [N1972](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1972.htm) .

### Proposed Committee Response

> The committee agrees that such uses should probably have been prohibited in the
> original specification and may consider adding such restrictions in a possible
> future revision of the Standard, and has recorded this intent in WG 14 Standing
> Document 3\.
> 
> Although the committee agrees that such invocations are not necessarily best
> practice, they are supported in existing implementations and as such the
> committee sees no benefit to accepting changes that would invalidate this
> practice.
