### Response

A `typedef` introduces a name for a type. This is not a macro, and the type must
indeed be “magically parenthesized.” In

```c
 typedef int *ip;
 ip x;
 const ip y;
```

the type of `x` is *pointer to* `int`, and the type of `y` is `const` *pointer
to* `int`. This is exactly analogous to the fact that

```c
 ip x1, x2;
```

declares both `x1` and `x2` as having the type *pointer to* `int`, and is not to
be read as

```c
 int *x1, x2;
```
