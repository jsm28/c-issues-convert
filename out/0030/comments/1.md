### Response

Subclause 7.5.1 does not give license for an implementation to set `errno` to
`EDOM` for `sin(DBL_MAX)`. The mathematical function is defined for that
argument value. While a conforming hosted implementation must not set `errno` to
`EDOM` for this case, the standard imposes no constraint on the accuracy of the
result value.
