Undefined behavior not previously listed in subclause G2:

1\. Applying `sizeof` to an enumerate type, as in

```c
enum f {c = sizeof (enum f)}
```

has undefined behavior.

2\. A program containing no function called `main` has undefined behavior.

3\. A storage class specifier or type-qualifier modifying the keyword `void` as
a function parameter-type-list has undefined behavior.

4\. Indexing an array beyond its specified size, as in:

```c
int a[4][5];
 a[1][7] = 0;
```

has undefined behavior.

5\. If a “shall” or “shall not” requirement that appears outside of a constraint
is violated, the behavior is undefined.

6\. In pointer-integer conversion, the size of integer required and the result
are implementation-defined. If the space provided is not long enough, the
behavior is undefined.

7\. The result of the `%` operator is the remainder. In both this and the divide
operations, if the value of the second operand is zero, the behavior is
undefined.

8\. As with any other arithmetic overflow, if the result does not fit in the
space provided, the behavior is undefined.

9\. If a file with the same name as a standard header, not provided as part of
the implementation, is placed in any of the standard places for a source file to
be included, the behavior is undefined.

10\. If the signal handler `func(int sig)` executes a `return` statement and the
value of `sig` was `SIGFPE` or any other implementation-defined value
corresponding to a computational exception, the behavior is undefined.

11\. If any signal is generated by an asynchronous signal handler, the behavior
is undefined.

12\. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.

13\. If a fully expanded macro replacement list contains a function-like macro
name as its last preprocessing token, it is unspecified whether this macro name
may be subsequently replaced. If the behavior of the program depends upon this
unspecified behavior, then the behavior is undefined. For example:

```c
#define f(a)    a*g
 #define g(a)   f(a)
```

the invocation `f(2) (9)` results in undefined behavior.

14\. A call to a library function that exceeds an **Environmental limit** has
undefined behavior.
