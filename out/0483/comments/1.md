Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee notes that these issues are also raised in the WG21 C\+\+
> committee document
> [N4220](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/www/docs/papers/2014/n4220.pdf).
> However, the committee also notes that among all implementations “nobody gets
> this wrong” and as such there is no actual confusion, and although there is
> sentiment that the standard might not perfectly express its intent, it is clear
> enough to warrant no change.

### Proposed Committee Response

> The committee believes that since there is no evidence of confusion over the
> intent of the standard in this area by any implementor that there is no defect
> worth correcting at this time.
