### Committee Discussion

* The issue is found in Annex K.3.5.4.1p3, not p2.
* The Microsoft implementation appears to treat this as a runtime-constraint violation.
* The Dikumware implementation leaves this behavior unspecified.

### Committee Discussion

* Given that footnote 404 already provides guidance on this issue, the author and the committee agree that the answer to the question posed is indeed yes.
* The other issue with respect to `s[0]` cannot be set to the null character when `s==NULL` has been determined to be resolved by the following changes.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In Annex K.3.5.4.1, replace paragraph 3 with the following:

> If there is a runtime-constraint violation, characters are read and discarded
> from `stdin` until a new-line character is read, or end-of-file or a read error
> occurs, and if `s` is not a null pointer `s[0]` is set to the null character.
