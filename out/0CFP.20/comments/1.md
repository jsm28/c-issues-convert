Oct 2018 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> A new paper [N2254](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2254.pdf)
> was split out from
> [N2211](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2211.pdf) that
> incorporates directly the Suggested Technical Corrigendum already extracted
> above.
>
> The committee accepts the Suggested Technical Corrigendum as the Proposed Change
> to resolve this issue.

### Proposed Change

In 7.1, omit:

> Change footnote 361\) from:
>
> > 361\)  If the minimum-width IEC60559 extended format (64 bits of precision) is
> > supported, `DECIMAL_DIG` shall be at least 21\. If IEC 60559 double (53 bits of
> > precision) is the widest IEC 60559 format supported, then `DECIMAL_DIG` shall be
> > at least 17\. (By contrast, `LDBL_DIG` and `DBL_DIG` are 18 and 15,
> > respectively, for these formats.)
>
> to:
>
> > 361\)  If the minimum-width IEC 60559 binary64-extended format (64 bits of
> > precision) is supported, `DECIMAL_DIG` shall be at least 21\. If IEC 60559
> > binary64 (53 bits of precision) is the widest IEC 60559 format supported, then
> > `DECIMAL_DIG` shall be at least 17\. (By contrast, `LDBL_DIG` and `DBL_DIG` are
> > 18 and 15, respectively, for these formats.)

In 10.1, change:

> After F.5#2, insert:
>
> > \[2a\] The `<float.h>` header defines the macro
> >
> > ```c
> > CR_DECIMAL_DIG
> > ```
> >
> > if and only if `__STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__` is defined as a macro at the
> > point in the source file where `<float.h>` is first included. If defined,
> > `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` expands to an integral constant expression suitable for use in
> > `#if` preprocessing directives whose value is a number such that conversions
> > between all supported types with IEC 60559 binary formats and character
> > sequences with at most `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` significant decimal digits are correctly
> > rounded. The value of `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` shall be at least `DECIMAL_DIG` \+ 3\. If
> > the implementation correctly rounds for all numbers of significant decimal
> > digits, then `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` shall have the value of the macro `UINTMAX_MAX`.
> >
> > \[2b\] Conversions of types with IEC 60559 binary formats to character sequences
> > with more than `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` significant decimal digits shall correctly round
> > to `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` significant digits and pad zeros on the right.
> >
> > \[2c\] Conversions from character sequences with more than `CR_DECIMAL_DIG`
> > significant decimal digits to types with IEC 60559 binary formats shall
> > correctly round to an intermediate character sequence with `CR_DECIMAL_DIG`
> > significant decimal digits, according to the applicable rounding direction, and
> > correctly round the intermediate result (having `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` significant
> > decimal digits) to the destination type. The “inexact” floating-point exception
> > is raised (once) if either conversion is inexact. (The second conversion may
> > raise the “overflow” or “underflow” floating-point exception.)
>
> In F.5#2c, attach a footnote to the wording:
>
> > The “inexact” floating-point exception is raised (once) if either conversion is
> > inexact.
>
> where the footnote is:
>
> > \*) The intermediate conversion is exact only if all input digits after the
> > first `CR_DECIMAL_DIG` digits are `0`**.**
>
> to:
>
> Replace the content of F.5 with:
>

> > value of the *T*`_DECIMAL_DIG` macros for IEC 60559 binary formats. If the
> > implementation correctly rounds for all numbers of significant decimal digits,

> In F.5#3, attach a footnote to the wording:
