2005-09-28

The Committee decision was to withdraw the answers to 2 and 3, see 6.3.1.1;p2.

**Question 1:** Must bit-fields of type `char` nevertheless have the same
signedness as ordinary objects of type `char`, and similarly for those of types
`short` (or `short int`), `long` (or `long int`), `long long` (or `long long
int`)?

> This is unspecified in the Standard \- No.

**Question 2:** But what should `sizeof(int)` evaluate to, when `(x.a + x.b)`
has such a bit-field type which does not occupy an integer number of bytes?

> It must be something larger than `int`.

**Question 3:** Must an implementation define representations occupying an
integer number of bytes (with some padding bits) for all such types, although
such representations would have no use other than to define the result of
sizeof?

> Yes.

#### Spring 2006 discussion

Consider this relevant citation:

6.3.1.1 **Boolean, characters, and integers**

2 The following may be used in an expression wherever an `int` or `unsigned int`
may be used:

— An object or expression with an integer type whose integer conversion rank is
less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int.

— A bit-field of type `_Bool`, `int`, `signed int`, or `unsigned int`.

If an int can represent all values of the original type, the value is converted
to an `int`; otherwise, it is converted to an `unsigned int`. These are called
the integer promotions.<sup>48\)</sup> All other types are unchanged by the
integer promotions. 48\) The integer promotions are applied only: as part of the
usual arithmetic conversions, to certain argument expressions, to the operands
of the unary `+`, `-`, and `~` operators, and to both operands of the shift
operators, as specified by their respective subclauses.

This citation supports the committee's view that the type of a bit-field does
not include the width; if `int:7` were a type that is different from `int`, then
these rules would not apply to any bit-field type, an obviously incorrect
conclusion.

**Question 1:** Must bit-fields of type char nevertheless have the same
signedness as ordinary objects of type `char`, and similarly for those of types
`short` (or `short int`), `long` (or `long int`), `long long` (or `long long
int`)?

> These are all determined by the implementation-defined behavior specified in
> 6.7.2.1#4.

**Question 2:** But what should `sizeof(x.a + x.b)` evaluate to, when `(x.a +
x.b)` has such a bit-field type which does not occupy an integer number of
bytes?

> In the example presented above, the type is `unsigned long long`, and it does
> occupy an integral number of bytes. The expression evaluates to `sizeof(unsigned
> long long)`.

| Note: | This DR was marked to move into *Review* status after the Spring 2006 meeting. However, the document voted on at the Spring 2006 meeting had no **Proposed** text only **Discussion** text. The Editor decided to leave the DR as *Open* and allow the Committee to decide on the **Proposed** text for this DR at the Fall 2006 meeting. |

#### Fall 2006 discussion

**Question 1:** Must bit-fields of type `char` nevertheless have the same
signedness as ordinary objects of the `char`, and similarly for those of types
`short` (or `short int`), `long` (or `long int`), `long long` (or `long long
int`)?

these would all be implementation-defined, determined by the
implementation-defined behavior specified in 6.7.2.1#4.

**Question 2:** But what should `sizeof(x.a + x.b)` evaluate to, when `(x.a +
x.b)`has such a bit-field type which does not occupy an integer number of bytes?

In example presented above, this would be implementation-defined, determined by
the implementation-defined behavior specified in 6.7.2.1#4.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Last sentence of paragraph 2 of 6.3.1.1, add the words *as restricted by the
width, for a bit-field* as follows:

> If an `int` can represent all values of the original type (as restricted by the
> width, for a bit-field), the type is converted to an `int`;
