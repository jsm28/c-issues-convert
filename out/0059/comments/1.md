### Response

The C Standard intentionally contains no prohibition against leaving a type
incomplete. (As you so aptly observe, `void` is an incomplete type that is never
completed.) There is no need to make a positive statement about the absence of a
prohibition.

Moreover, the examples were not intended to represent that mutual referencing
was the only reason for permitting incomplete structure types. Opaque data types
were considered, and endorsed, by the Committee when drafting the C Standard.
