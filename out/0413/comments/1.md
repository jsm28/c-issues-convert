Feb 2012 Meeting

### Committee Discussion

> * It was noted that this is basically similar to [dr\_253](issue:0253).
> * The following was proposed, but there was no consensus for adoption.
>   > The initialization shall occur in initializer list order, each initializer
>   > provided for a particular subobject overriding any previously listed initializer
>   > for the same subobject <sup>151\)</sup>. Subsequently, all subobjects that are
>   > not initialized explicitly previously shall be initialized implicitly the same
>   > as objects that have static storage duration.

### Committee Discussion

> * The original author intended the result to be 42 by the following reasoning:
> * 6.7.9 paragraphs 17-18 specify that each designator list affects only the smallest subobject to which the designator list refers. As a result, the second clause of paragraph 19 occurs once for the greater object as a whole, filling in only those parts of the whole object that were never initialized explicitly.
> * **gcc** and some IBM compilers give the result as 0, although it is not believed that there is code dependent on this interpretation.
> * David Keaton proposed [N1659](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1659.pdf).
> * This, however, does not clarify the interpreted conflict of paragraph 19 "subobjects that are not initialized explicitly \[shall be set to zero]" applied "recursively to subaggregates" (paragraph 20).
> * Adding the example is a desired outcome.

### Committee Discussion

> There was no work performed on this DR.

### Committee Discussion

> There has been considerable discussion and several proposals ( N1659, N1749) to
> clarify the standard to no avail. Upon reflection, and consultation with the
> author, we believe that the proper course of action is twofold. First, simply
> answer the question asked as the committee believes that the standard already
> specifies correctly. To add clarification to the standard we will also add the
> examples from N1659 that leads to this answer.

### Proposed Committee Response

The proper answer to the question raised according to the standard is that the
value of l.t.k is 42, because implicit initialization does not override explicit
initialization. We will also provide a non-normative example to further clarify
the intent.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Add the following example to 6.7.9:

```c
    typedef struct {
        int k;
        int l;
        int a[2];
    } T;

    typedef struct {
        int i;
        T t;
    } S;

    T x = {.l = 43, .k = 42, .a[1] = 19, .a[0] = 18 };

    void f(void)
    {
        S l = { 1, .t = x, .t.l = 41, .t.a[1] = 17};
    }
```

The value of l.t.k is 42, because implicit initialization does not override
explicit initialization.
