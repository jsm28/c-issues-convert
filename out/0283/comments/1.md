### Technical Corrigendum

Attach a new footnote 78a to the words "named member" in 6.5.2.3#3:

> 78a If the member used to access the contents of a union object is not the same
> as the member last used to store a value in the object, the appropriate part of
> the object representation of the value is reinterpreted as an object
> representation in the new type as described in 6.2.6 (a process sometimes called
> "type punning"). This might be a trap representation.
