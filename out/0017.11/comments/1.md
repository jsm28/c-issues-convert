### Response

The proposed example is valid. Nothing in the standard prohibits it.

The relevant citation is subclause 6.5.2.3 Semantics, paragraph 2:

> A declaration of the form
> 
> ```c
>     struct-or-union  identifier ;
> ```
> 
> specifies a structure or union type and declares a tag, both visible only within
> the scope in which the declaration occurs. It specifies a new type distinct from
> any type with the same tag in an enclosing scope (if any).
