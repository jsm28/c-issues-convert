### Technical Corrigendum

Change 6.2.6.1 paragraph #6 to:

> When a value is stored in an object of structure or union type, including in a
> member object, the bytes of the object representation that correspond to any
> padding bytes take unspecified value.<sup>42\)</sup> The value of a struct or
> union object is never a trap representation, even though the value of a member
> of a struct or union object may be a trap representation.

Change footnote 42 to:

> 42\) Thus, for example, structure assignment need not copy any padding bits.

Change 6.2.6.1 paragraph #7 to:

> When a value is stored in a member of an object of union type, the bytes of the
> object representation that do not correspond to that member but do correspond to
> other members take unspecified values.
