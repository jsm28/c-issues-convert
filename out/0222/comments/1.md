### Committee Discussion (for history only)

A TC should remove the notion of objects of struct or union type having a trap
representation. Changes need to be made to 6.2.6.1 paragraphs 6 and 7, and
footnote 42\. It was observed that the point of the original footnote was
primarily to illustrate one reason why padding bits might not be copied: because
member-by-member assignment might be performed. But member-by-member assignment
would imply that struct assignment could produce undefined behavior if a member
of the struct had a value that was a trap representation. Instead of adding
further text explaining that member values that were trap representations were
not permitted to render assignment of a containing struct or union object
undefined (e.g. if member-by-member copying were used), it was decided that the
footnote should simply clarify the issue of padding bits directly.
