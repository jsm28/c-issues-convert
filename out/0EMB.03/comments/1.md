Problem: 4.1.6.2.1 (Binary arithmetic operations), last para, the text on the
divi functions has 'yielding a fixed-point type result' while the divi functions
have an integer result.

Solution: Change 'yielding a fixed-point type result'; this must be 'yielding an
integer type result'

Change: Modify 4.1.6.2.1 para 5 accordingly.
