**Committee Discussion** (for history only)  
The semantics and grammar overlap.  
The grammar says "this is an expression".  
The semantics says "this is a constant expression"

### Committee Response

> The Committee agrees with your analysis of "constant expression" and the
> division into four categories.
> 
> We agree that line P1 is legitimate because "(1-1)" is a constant expression.
> Lines P2 and S1 do not include constant expressions because:
> 
> * they contain a comma operator (forbidden by 6.6#3)
> * there is a valid interpretation of the code that uses a non-constant expression.
> 
> Line S1 is legitimate, while line P2 violates the constraints of 6.5.16.1#3 (the
> right hand side must either have pointer to character or pointer to void type,
> or must be a null pointer constant). Line X1 violates the same constraint for
> the same reason (this was also addressed in DR 064).
> 
> Line X2 is legitimate because there is no requirement for the right hand side to
> be a constant expression. Lines X3 and X4 are legitimate because the expressions
> are constant expressions with value `0` and therefore null pointer constants.
> 
> The Committee also agrees that:
> 
> ```c
>     int fla [(0+5)];     // is a normal array, not variably modified
>     int vla [(0,5)];     // is a variable length array
> ```
> 
> In general, the interpretation of an expression for constantness is context
> sensitive. For any expression which contains only constants:
> 
> * If the syntax or context only permits a constant expression, the constraints of 6.6#3 and 6.6#4 shall apply.
> * Otherwise, if the expression meets the requirements of 6.6 (including any form accepted in accordance with 6.6#10), it is a constant expression.
> * Otherwise it is not a constant expression.
> 
> In summary, provided the above points are taken account of, the Committee does
> not believe the Standard is ambiguous nor that it is necessary to modify it to
> make this clearer.
