### Response

Whether the language processor is an interpreter or a true compiler does not
affect the language rules about when the size of an object is needed. Both a
compiler and an interpreter must act as if the translation phases in subclause
5.1.1.2 were followed. This is a requirement that an implementation act as if
the entire program is translated before the program's execution.

The “shall” in Footnote 63 in subclause 6.5.2.3 carries no special meaning: this
footnote, like all other footnotes in the standard, is provided to emphasize the
consequences of the rules in the standard. The footnote is not part of the
standard.

The Committee believes that a careful reading of the standard shows all of the
places that the size of an object is needed, and that the translation phases
prevent those requirements from being relaxed by an implementation.
