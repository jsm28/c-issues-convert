### Correction

***In subclause 6.5.7, page 71, line 39, change:***

All unnamed structure or union members are ignored during initialization.

***to:***

Except where explicitly stated otherwise, for the purposes of this subclause
unnamed members of objects of structure and union type do not participate in
initialization. Unnamed members of structure objects have indeterminate value
even after initialization. A union object containing only unnamed members has
indeterminate value even after initialization.

***In subclause 6.5.7, page 72, line 11, change:***

The initial value of the object is that of the expression.

***to:***

The initial value of the object, including unnamed members, is that of the
expression.
