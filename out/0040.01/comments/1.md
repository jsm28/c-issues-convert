### Response

```c
void f(const int);
 void f(int a)
 {
 a = 4;
 }
```

What is the composite type of `f`?

Answer: `void f(int)`. [Defect Report #013, Question 1](issue:0013.01) describes
the correct manner for constructing the composite type.

Is the assignment valid?

Answer: Yes. The type of a parameter is independent of the composite type of the
function, so the assignment is valid (cf. subclause 6.7.1).

Another example:

```c
int f(int a[4]);
 int f(int a[5]);
```

The parameters are compatible because they are converted to *pointer to ...*,
but what is the composite type?

Answer: The response to the Defect Report mentioned above answers this question
as well.
