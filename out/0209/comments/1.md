7.18.4 Macros for integer constants

> \[#1] The following function-like macros<sup>220</sup> expand to integer
> constant expressions suitable for initializing objects that have integer types
> corresponding to types defined in \<`stdint.h`\>. Each macro name corresponds to
> a similar type name in 7.18.1.2 or 7.18.1.5.
>
> \[#2] The argument in any instance of these macros shall be a decimal, octal, or
> hexadecimal constant (as defined in 6.4.4.1) with a value that does not exceed
> the limits for the corresponding type.

Add:

> \[#3] Each invocation of one of these macros shall expand to an integer constant
> expression suitable for use in `#if` preprocessing directives. The type of the
> expression shall have the same type as would an expression that is an object of
> the corresponding type converted according to the integer promotions. The value
> of the expression shall be that of the argument.

*Most of the following wording is taken almost exactly from* `<limits.h>`

7.18.4.1 Macros for minimum-width integer constants

Remove:

> \[#1] Each of the following macros expands to an integer constant having the
> value specified by its argument and a type with at least the specified
> width.<sup>221</sup>)
>
> <sup>221</sup> For each name described in 7.18.1.2 that the implementation
> provides, the corresponding macro in this subclause is required.

Change \[#2] to:

> \[#2] The macro `INT`*N*`_C(`*value* `)` shall expand to an integer constant
> expression corresponding to the type `int_least`*N*`_t`. The macro
> `UINT`*N*`_C(`*value* `)` shall expand to an integer constant expression
> corresponding to the type `uint_least`*N*`_t`. For example, if `uint_least64_t`
> is a name for the type `unsigned long long int`, then `UINT64_C(0x123)` might
> expand to the integer constant `0x123ULL`.

7.18.4.2 Macros for greatest-width integer constants

> \[#1] The following macro expands to an integer constant expression having the
> value specified by its argument and the type `intmax_t`:
>
> > `INTMAX_C(`*value*`)`
>
> The following macro expands to an integer constant expression having the value
> specified by its argument and the type `uintmax_t`:
>
> > `UINTMAX_C(`*value*`)`
