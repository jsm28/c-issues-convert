### Technical Corrigendum

7.19.6.1 The `fprintf` function:

Page 279, Paragraph 12 should be changed from:

> If `FLT_RADIX` is not a power of 2, the result should be one of the two adjacent
> numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given precision, with the extra
> stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding
> direction.

to:

> For `a` and `A` conversions, if `FLT_RADIX` is not a power of 2 and the result
> is not exactly representable in the given precision, the result should be one of
> the two adjacent numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given precision,
> with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the
> current rounding direction.

7.20.1.3 The `strtod` ... functions:

Page 308, paragraph 8 should be changed from:

> If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and `FLT_RADIX` is not a power
> of 2, the result should be one of the two numbers in the appropriate internal
> format that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating source value, with the
> extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current
> rounding direction.

to:

> If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form, `FLT_RADIX` is not a power of
> 2 and the result is not exactly representable, the result should be one of the
> two numbers in the appropriate internal format that are adjacent to the
> hexadecimal floating source value, with the extra stipulation that the error

7.24.2.1 The `fwprintf` function:

Page 354, Paragraph 12 should be changed from:

> If `FLT_RADIX` is not a power of 2, the result should be one of the two adjacent
> numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given precision, with the extra
> stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding
> direction.

7.24.4.1.1 The `wcstod` ... functions:

Page 372, paragraph 8 should be changed from:

> If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and `FLT_RADIX` is not a power
> of 2, the result should be one of the two numbers in the appropriate internal
