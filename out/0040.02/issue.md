Is an implementation that fails to equal (or exceed) the value of an
environmental limit conforming? Subclause 5.2.4 says that those in that
subclause must be equalled in a conforming implementation. There is no such
wording for the environmental limits in the Library (subclauses 7.9.2, 7.9.3,
7.9.4.4, 7.9.6.1, 7.10.2.1).
