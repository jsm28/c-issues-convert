### Response

Subclause 7.9.6.2 says, “A directive that is an ordinary multibyte character is
executed by reading the next *characters* ...” \[emphasis added]. Consistently
throughout the standard, plain “characters” refers to one-byte characters. (See
subclause 3.5 for the definition of “character.”)
