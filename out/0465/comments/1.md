### Committee Discussion

> The Suggested Technical Corrigendum needed revision, and new words were crafted
> and adopted. One consequence from this change that a NULL pointer is now a valid
> argument.

Apr 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> No revisions were deemed necessary. Value 1 remains in 7.17.5p1 for
> implementations where only the runtime can determine if an operation on a
> particular type is lock-free due to architectural differences.

Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> As solicited, a new paper
> [N1976](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1976.htm) was
> presented and discussed to clarify that null pointers to atomic types are
> allowed and thus can be used at compile time. After discussion, the Proposed
> Technical Corrigendum was modified to incorporate this point as a non-normative
> explanatory footnote.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Change 7.17.5.1 paragraph 2 from:

> The `atomic_is_lock_free` generic function indicates whether or not the object
> pointed to by `obj` is lock-free.

to:

> The `atomic_is_lock_free` generic function indicates whether or not atomic
> operations on objects of the type pointed to by `obj` are lock-free.

Change 7.17.5.1 paragraph 3 from:

> The `atomic_is_lock_free` generic function returns nonzero (true) if and only if
> the object's operations are lock-free. The result of a lock-free query on one
> object cannot be inferred from the result of a lock-free query on another
> object.

to:

> The `atomic_is_lock_free` generic function returns nonzero (true) if and only if
> atomic operations on objects of the type pointed to by the argument are
> lock-free. In any given program execution, the result of the lock-free query
> shall be consistent for all pointers of the same type.<sup>new</sup>

<sup>new)</sup>`obj` may be a null pointer.
