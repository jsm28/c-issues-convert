### Committee Discussion

5.2.4.2.2 paragraph 4 (which covers the accuracy of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and math
library functions) does not cover decimal \<--\> binary conversions. Therefore,
the rest of 5.2.4.2.2 covers these conversions (F.P. characteristics must meet
the minimum-maximum requirements for the \<`float.h`\> parameters (even though
the exact model need not be followed)). That appears to require that the actual
representation be able to express \>\= `FLT`/`DBL`/`LDBL_DIG` digits precise to
the last of those digits (for decimal to binary conversions) and \>\=
`DECIMAL_DIG` digits (for binary to decimal conversions).

6.3.1.5 para. 1 implies that the different widths of F.P. types must have
similar representations differing only in number of bits in exponent, mantissa,
and padding.

In 7.19.6.1 `f,F` format, the value is rounded to the appropriate number of
digits, which indicates that the displayed value differs from the "numerical"
value only with regard to that rounding. (Of course, *all* the `fprintf`
conversions of numeric values to display form are on the assumption that what is
displayed is the same value as the numeric value, but in human-comprehensible
form and subject to specified rounding etc.)

7.20.1.3 says that the numeric string is interpreted as a value according to the
rules in 6.4.4.2 for floating constants.

Details of rounding are not specified, although certain modes are described in
5.2.4.2.2.

The latitude allowed for inexactness by the standard applies only to precision
of representation and to rounding mode.
