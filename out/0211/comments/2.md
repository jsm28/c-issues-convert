### Technical Corrigendum

Change 5.2.4.2.2 paragraph #4 to:

> The accuracy of the floating-point operations ( `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and of the
> library functions in \<`math.h`\> and \<`complex.h`\> that return floating-point
> results is implementation defined, as is the accuracy of the conversion between
> floating-point internal representations and string representations performed by
> the libray routine in \<`stdio.h`\>, \<`stdlib.h`\> and \<`wchar.h`\>. The
> implementation may state that the accuracy is unknown.
