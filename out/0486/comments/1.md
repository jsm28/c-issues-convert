Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee agrees that there are small inconsistencies remaining in the standard but that they are largely editorial in nature, and yet of potentially of such a sweeping scope that is difficult to assess as a defect. In particular, the various uses of *load/store*, *read/write*, and *fetch/assign* should be clarified and made consistent where possible. It may be advantageous to use ISO standardized vocabulary for this and perhaps other new terms introduced in C11.
* Additional related issues were raised in [(SC22WG14.13844) atomic\_fetch and modify generic functions](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13844).
* The committee does not feel that this DR is “actionable” and should, in this form, result in a Proposed Committee Response. The author is encouraged to extract and provide in a new paper a simpler list of inconsistencies that can be addressed in a DR. The author is also solicited to address the broader issues as a proposal in a new paper for consideration in a new revision of the standard.

### Committee Discussion

The proposed changes to §6.2.6.1 paragraph 9 are superfluous and unnecessary.

The other changes require a comprehensive review of the standard and as such
will be addressed in a future revision of the standard.
