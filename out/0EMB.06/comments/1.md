Problem: The replacement text for 7.18a.6.1 (on fixed-point arithmetic support
functions) does not specify what happens if an integer result overflows.

Solution: Undefined behavior is implied by default in the C standard. Mention in
the descriptive text that this should result in undefined behavior.

Change: In 4.1.6.2.1 para 5, add the following sentence to the end of the
paragraph: If an integer result of one of these functions overflows, the
behavior is undefined.
