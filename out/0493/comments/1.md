### Committee Discussion

> This DR records the committee’s understanding of the intent of the standard. The
> resolution to [DR 469](issue:0469) must include a Proposed Technical Corrigendum
> consistent with the answers provided below.
> 
> As one example required to be resolved in [DR 469](issue:0469),
> 
> > change ‘creates’ to ‘initializes’ in `mtx_init` and `mtx_destroy`,

Oct 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> After extensive discussion, the committee response for the return value for
> `mtx_init` when passed a null pointer was changed.

Apr 2018 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The papers [N2190](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2190.htm),
> [N2191](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2191.htm),
> [N2192](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2192.htm), and
> [N12193](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2193.htm) were
> discussed as directions for a future revision of the standard.
> 
> There are similar and potentially interrelated issues with respect to `cnd_t`.
> 
> The committee solicited a combined comprehensive resolution for these issues
> with those raised in [DR 469](issue:0469) and [DR 479](issue:0479).

### Proposed Committee Response

> This document asks quite a number of questions, and they are answered according
> to the section title in which they were asked. These answers rely on changes
> made in [DR 469](issue:0469).
> 
> **Problems with `mtx_t`**
> 
> The semantics of copying a `mtx_t` are not specified, much like `FILE`
> §7.21.3p6.
> 
> **Problems with `mtx_init()`**
> 
> 1. `mtx_init` will attempt to initialize whatever memory is referenced by the pointer passed in, so it will initialize static memory preset to zero. Such calls are valid.
> 2. `mtx_init` will attempt to initialize whatever memory is referenced by the pointer passed in, so it will initialize memory that has previously been used as a `mtx_t`.
> 3. It is undefined behavior to call `mtx_init()` on memory without an intervening `mtx_destroy`.
> 4. It is undefined behavior to call `mtx_init()` on memory without an intervening `mtx_destroy` regardless of the lock condition.
> 5. See [DR 414](issue:0414) for the resolution to the miscounted variations of `mtx_init()` options.
> 6. Undefined behavior is the result of passing values other than those specified in the standard. The wording in the Standard shall change from ‘must’ to ‘shall’ in §7.26.4.2p2.
> 7. The value returned by `mtx_init()` when passed a NULL pointer shall be unspecified.
> 
> **Problems with `mtx_destroy()`**
> 
> 1. It is undefined behavior to call `mtx_destroy()` with a pointer to an object that has not been initialized by a call to `mtx_init()`. In §7.26.4.1p2 the editor should consider changing ‘can’ to ‘shall’.
> 2. It is undefined behavior to call `mtx_destroy()` with a pointer to an object that has not been initialized by a call to `mtx_init()`, so calling it twice without an intervening `mtx_init` results in undefined behavior.
> 3. Calling `mtx_destroy()` while it is locked is intended to be undefined and will be resolved by [DR 469](issue:0469).
> 4. The memory that had been used as an `mtx_t` object has indeterminate value. Undefined behavior results if it is subsequently used as an argument to other `mtx` functions other than `mtx_init`.
> 
> **Other Problems**
> 
> 1. Memory with indeterminate value is appropriate to be used only with `mtx_init` as described above. All other uses result in undefined behavior.
> 2. Static memory preset to zeros is appropriate to be used only with `mtx_init` as described above. All other uses result in undefined behavior.
> 3. The C Standard provides no mechanism to statically initialize a `mtx_t`.
> 4. There is the limit of 1 call to `mtx_init()` without an intervening call to `mtx_destroy()`.

Oct 2018 meeting

### Committee Response

> The "C17" edition of the standard has been published as IS 9899:2018.
> 
> These issues were not resolved in that publication.
> 
> The committee is now considering changes for the next revision of the standard,
> and asks that issues from [CR 469](issue:0469), [CR 479](issue:0479), and [CR
> 493](issue:0493), as well as potentially other small issues be combined in a new
> paper to completely resolve this issue for the next revision of the standard.
