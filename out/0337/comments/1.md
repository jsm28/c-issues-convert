### Committee discussion

#### Spring 2007

`FOPEN_MAX` is required to be at least 8, see 7.19.3 paragraph 13\. So
`FOPEN_MAX` does not require any additional words.

`BUFSIZ` likewise must be at least 256, see 7.19.2 paragraph 7\.

`FILENAME_MAX` 7.19.1 paragraph 3 requires that `FILENAME_MAX` must be at least
1\.

### Proposed Committee Response

All of these constants already have required minimum values that are positive,
non-zero. No changes are required.
