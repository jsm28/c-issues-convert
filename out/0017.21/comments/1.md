### Response

Concerning the first example:

```c
#define lparen (
 #define f_m(a) a
 f_m lparen "abc" )
```

According to subclause 5.1.1.2 **Translation phases**, page 5, lines 25-39, the
translation phases 1-3 do not cause macros to be expanded. Phase 4 does expand.
To apply subclause 6.8.3 **Macro replacement** page 89, lines 34-35 to the
example: Since `lparen` is not `(` in “`f_m lparen "abc" )`,” this construct is
not recognized as a function-like macro invocation. Therefore the example
expands to

```c
f_m("abc")
```

The same principle applies to the second example:

```c
#define i(x) 3
 #define a i(yz
 #define b )
 a b )       /* expands via the following stages: */

 i(yz b )    /* ) delimits the argument list before b is expanded  */
 i([yz ) ])
 3
```

This is how we interpret subclause 6.8.3, page 89, lines 36-38: The sequence of
preprocessing tokens is terminated by the right-parenthesis preprocessing token.
