Problem: The current specification allows global named-registers to be
initialized. It is however unclear when, and by whom this initialization should
be done (one could imagine that the register storage onto which the variable
maps does not really exist until some device is initialized by some user code).

Solution: Disallow initializers on named-register variables.

Change: Add the following new constraint to section 6.7: 'A declaration
containing a named- register storage-class specifier shall not contain an
initializer.'
