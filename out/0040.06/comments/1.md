### Response

a. Example:

> ```c
> struct t1 {
>  char c;
>  short s;
>  int i[offsetof(struct t1, s)];
>  };
> ```

This is *not* a valid use of the `offsetof` macro. The hypothetical `static`
*`type`* `t;` declaration required for `offsetof` (cf. subclause 7.1.6) could
not have validly appeared prior to the invocation of `offsetof` because the type
`struct t1` is incomplete (cf. subclause 6.7.2); therefore the `offsetof`
invocation is not strictly conforming.

b. The answer is the same as (a) above. In addition, the members mentioned in
these invocations are not in scope.

c. The answer is the same as (a) above. In addition, the members mentioned in
these invocations are not in scope.

d. The answer is the same as (a) above. In addition, the members mentioned in
these invocations are not in scope.
