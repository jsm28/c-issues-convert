### Correction

***In subclause 6.5.4.3, page 68, lines 22-25, change:***

(For each parameter declared with function or array type, its type for these
comparisons is the one that results from conversion to a pointer type, as in
6.7.1. For each parameter declared with qualified type, its type for these
comparisons is the unqualified version of its declared type.)

***to:***

(In the determination of type compatibility and of a composite type, each
parameter declared with function or array type is taken as having the type that
results from conversion to a pointer type, as in 6.7.1, and each parameter
declared with qualified type is taken as having the unqualified version of its
declared type.)
