### Response

Neither alternative (a) nor (b) in Question 1 fully captures the intent. What is
intended is exactly what is specified in the C Standard. A strictly conforming
program shall not produce output that varies depending upon details of
implementation of facilities defined by the standard headers. Hence, use of the
`offsetof` macro, in a context requiring an integer constant expression, per se
does not render a program not strictly conforming.

Further clarification provided by David Prosser:

Although the replacement for the `offsetof` macro must be an integral constant
expression, and must follow all the constraints appropriate to expressions, an
implementation is permitted to make use of its extensions to constant
expressions that behave like integral constant expressions. This is why the
sample replacement expressions for the `offsetof` macro in the Rationale are
valid candidates (for many implementations) but do not come under the strict
definition of integral constant expression that strictly conforming code must
follow. In particular, this is why the `offsetof` macro exists: there was
otherwise no portable means to compute such translation-time constants.
Therefore, of the two choices, (b) is the closest, but it is not the whole
story.
