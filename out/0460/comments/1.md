Oct 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The paper [N2072](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2072.htm) was presented which made the point that non-integral multiples of `alignment` are useful for allocating on, say, page size boundaries.
* The behavior on a value of zero has been left to the implementation to either support or reject, and this flexibility must be preserved.
* After discussion, the Suggested Technical Corrigendum from [(SC22WG14.14473) updated DR460 wording based on N2072](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14473) was adopted.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In section 7.22.3.1, change paragraph 2 from:

> The `aligned_alloc` function allocates space for an object whose alignment is
> specified by `alignment`, whose size is specified by `size`, and whose value is
> indeterminate. The value of `alignment` shall be a valid alignment supported by
> the implementation and the value of `size` shall be an integral multiple of
> `alignment`.

to:

> The `aligned_alloc` function allocates space for an object whose alignment is
> specified by `alignment`, whose size is specified by `size`, and whose value is
> indeterminate. If the value of `alignment` is not a valid alignment supported by
> the implementation the function shall fail by returning a null pointer.

In addition, in section **J.2 Undefined behavior**, remove the following bullet:

> â€” The alignment requested of the aligned\_alloc function is not valid or not
> supported by the implementation, or the size requested is not an integral
> multiple of the alignment (7.22.3.1).
