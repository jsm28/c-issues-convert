### Response

If one takes the general case, empty arguments in invocations of function-like
macros are easy to recognize:

```c
#define f(a,b,c) whatever

         f(,,)
```

These empty arguments all have “shadows” that cause the sentence you reference
in subclause 6.8.3 (page 90, lines 4-5) to be clearly in effect.

The only uncertain case is one in which an empty argument in an invocation of a
one-parameter function-like macro mimics a “no arguments” invocation. (It should
also be noted that the definition of a macro argument from clause 3 does not
preclude an empty sequence.) Thus the standard is clear that the behavior is
undefined in the example from your request. If an implementation does not choose
to allow empty arguments, a diagnostic will probably be emitted; otherwise, the
invocation will most likely be replaced by a preprocessing token sequence in
which the parameter is replaced with no tokens. But because the standard does
not define this, other than as a common extension, there are no guarantees.
