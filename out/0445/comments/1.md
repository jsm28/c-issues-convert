### Committee Discussion

* It is indeed the case that 6.2.8p3 "fundamental type" is not defined. The intention is that it be "basic type", such that "fundamental alignment" is well defined, and yet this is not the case, and "fundamental alignment" also needs a definition. It is likely that the definition of fundamental type can be made editorially, but that when and where fundamental alignment is required is substantive.
* It is also the case that 6.2.8p3 "contexts" is not defined. It is intended to mean the full set of storage durations. Perhaps we should say "storage duration contexts".
* It is also the case that "valid alignment" may not be a "fundamental alignment".
* It was the case in C99 that `malloc` was required to return memory appropriate for "any type", and this should not be lost in the new wording regarding types that are not over-aligned. All other C99 behaviors must also be preserved as he describes as guidance.
* All types declared without the \_Alignas directive are intended to have fundamental alignment, which must be tied somehow to basic type. A consequence is that the only manner in which one can produce an over-aligned type is through \_Alignas. `malloc` has been defined in terms of fundamental alignment, yet we do not anywhere strongly state that, say, `int` has such fundamental alignment.
* These are several interwoven definitions and missing definitions that need a comprehensive review for adequate correction. We solicit the author for a suggested technical corrigendum. A copy of the audio discussion can be provided.

### Committee Discussion

* The author provided input to [N1804](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1804.htm) as a proposed technical corrigendum:
* Change 6.2.8#2 to:
  > A fundamental alignment is a valid alignment less than or equal to `_Alignof
  > (max_align_t)`. Fundamental alignments shall be supported by the implementation
  > for objects of all storage durations. The alignment requirements of the
  > following types shall be fundamental alignments:
  >
  > + all atomic, qualified or unqualified basic types;
  > + all atomic, qualified or unqualified enumerated types;
  > + all atomic, qualified or unqualified pointer types;
  > + all array types whose element type has a fundamental alignment requirement;
  > + all types specified in clause 7 as complete object types;
  > + all structure or union types all of whose elements have types with fundamental alignment requirements and none of whose elements have an alignment specifier specifying an alignment that is not a fundamental alignment.

  In 6.2.8#3, change "the contexts in" to "the storage durations of objects for
  which".

  In 6.2.8#4, change "those values returned by an \_Alignof expression for
  fundamental types" to "fundamental alignments".

  (Note that the above admits the possibility that e.g. 1 and 4 are fundamental
  alignments, but 2 isn't, in which case it can't be an extended alignment either.
  If we want to ensure that 2 isn't a valid alignment at all in that case, rather
  than possibly having valid alignments that are neither fundamental nor extended,
  also change "additional implementation-defined set of values" to "additional
  implementation-defined set of extended alignments" in 6.2.8#4.) In 6.7.5#3,
  change "in the context in which it appears" to "for an object of the storage
  duration, if any, being declared". Add a new constraint at the end of 6.7.5#3:
  "An object shall not be declared with an over-aligned type with an extended
  alignment requirement not supported by the implementation for an object of that
  storage duration.".

  (This deals with the point that if an over-aligned struct is defined, then
  objects with that type may be supported with some storage durations but not
  others, so it is the declaration of an object with that type that can violate a
  constraint rather than the declaration of the struct.)

  In 7.19#2, change "whose alignment is as great as is supported by the
  implementation in all contexts" to "whose alignment is the greatest fundamental
  alignment".

  (I'm trying to avoid an undesirable implication that if an alignment of e.g. 1MB
  is supported in all contexts \- and it's quite plausible that an implementation
  can support more or less arbitrary alignments \- then max\_align\_t must have
  such an alignment and so such an alignment must count as fundamental and so
  malloc must return memory suitable aligned for it.)
* This is a difficult area and further study is required.
