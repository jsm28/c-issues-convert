Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee agrees that this clarification would be useful, that is, that `mtx_trylock` should fail if attempted on an already held non-recursive mutex. We did not agree that the Proposed Technical Corrigendum addressed this defect correctly.
* Coordinated new wording is solicited from the authors to both this and the solicited author for the resolution of [DR 469](issue:0469) since it also is proposing potentially overlapping wording changes in this area.

### Committee Discussion

> This resolution continues to be bound to [DR 469](issue:0469)

Apr 2018 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee solicited a combined comprehensive resolution for these issues
> with those raised in [DR 469](issue:0469) and [DR 493](issue:0493). The authors
> will be invited to review and provide input to said paper.
>
> As discussed in committee, an approach for resolving copying that parallels FILE
> treatment will be considered. In that case, 7.21.3p6 is germaine:
>
> > The address of a `FILE` object used to control a stream may be significant; a
> > copy of a `FILE` object need not serve in place of the original.
>
> The committee advised that this alone would not be sufficient, but would serve
> as a preferred starting point.

### Committee Response

> The "C17" edition of the standard has been published as IS 9899:2018.
>
> These issues were not resolved in that publication.
>
> The committee is now considering changes for the next revision of the standard,
> and asks that issues from [CR 469](issue:0469), [CR 479](issue:0479), and [CR
> 493](issue:0493), as well as potentially other small issues be combined in a new
> paper to completely resolve this issue for the next revision of the standard.
