Problem: If \_X and \_Y are address spaces with \_Y enclosing \_X, after the
declarations

```c
_X char a;


_Y char *p = &a;
```

the dereference \*p is undefined because of the way TR 18037 applies the notion
of effective type (C Standard 6.5, paragraphs 6 and 7). This makes overlapping
named address spaces unusable by strictly conforming code in most circumstances.

Solution: In the detailed changes to the C Standard, modify the definition of
*effective type* (clause 6.5, paragraph 6\) to exclude address space qualifiers,
and restore the rules in paragraph 7 to their original form. (Note that the
whole concept of *effective type* is used only in 6.5 and in one footnote
elsewhere in the C Standard.) This makes TR 18037's definition of *additionally
access-qualified version* of a type (in the new text for 6.2.5) unnecessary.

Changes: Change the replacement text for clause 6.5 of the C Standard to the
following:

> **Clause 6.5 \- Expressions**, replace the first two sentences of paragraph 6
> with:
> 
> The *effective type* of an object for an access to its stored value is the
> declared type of the object, if any, without any address-space qualifier that
> the declared type may have.<sup>72\)</sup> If a value is stored into an object
> having no declared type through an lvalue having a type that is not a character
> type, then the type of the lvalue, without any address-space qualifier, becomes
> the effective type of the object for that access and for subsequent accesses
> that do not modify the stored value.

Remove the sentence defining *additionally access-qualified version* from TR
18037 (first paragraph replacing paragraph 26 of 6.2.5).
