### Response

In fact 3, we presume the second sentence was intended to be: “A character
*constant* is regarded as having type `char`,” in order to be applicable to this
request. That is not true; a character constant is of type `int`. Also facts 1-4
deal with the single-byte chars and not the extended character set.

In any case, the facts as listed do not logically lead to the conclusion that
`MB_CUR_MAX` must be one (1) in the `"C"` locale. In fact, this conclusion is
not true. It is possible for `MB_CUR_MAX` to be greater than one in the `"C"`
locale. In subclause 7.10, page 149, `MB_CUR_MAX` is “the maximum number of
bytes in a multibyte character for the extended character set specified by the
current locale.” In subclause 7.4.1.1, page 107, the `"C"` locale is “the
minimal environment for C translation.” The minimal environment may still
require more than one byte for multibyte characters.
