### Committee Discussion

The Committee agrees that “function arguments” should be “function parameters”.
The cited text from 6.7p7 refers to the declarations of parameters in the
definition of that function; each parameter declares an object whose adjusted
type is required to be complete. Declarations of parameters in prototypes which
are not part of the definition of that function are permitted to declare
incomplete types. Whenever that function is called, arguments are implicitly
converted to the types of the corresponding parameters; see 6.5.2.2p7. The
requirements upon assignment require that the types of the corresponding
parameters are complete types, at the point of calling the function. The
constraint at 6.5.16p2 requires a modifiable lvalue for the left operand of
assignment, and according to 6.3.2.1p1, a modifiable lvalue shall not have
incomplete type.

The Committee agrees that there do not appear to be any constraints forbidding
constructions like

> ```c
> void func(void parm);
> ```

nor are any semantics provided for this construction.

### Technical Corrigendum
