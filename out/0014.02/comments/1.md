### Correction

***Add to subclause 7.9.6.2, page 137, line 4 (the*** `n` ***conversion
specifier):***

No argument is converted, but one is consumed. If the conversion specification
with this conversion specifier is not one of `%n`, `%ln`, or `%hn`, the behavior
is undefined.

***Add to subclause 7.9.6.2, page 138, another Example:***

In:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 /* ... */
 int d1, d2, n1, n2, i;
 i = sscanf("123", "%d%n%n%d",&d1, &n1, &n2, &d2);
```

the value 123 is assigned to `d1` and the value 3 to `n1` . Because `%n` can
never get an input failure the value of 3 is also assigned to `n2`. The value of
`d2` is not affected. The value 3 is assigned to `i`.
