### Committee Discussion

The Committee discussed adding a footnote to 6.7.5.3 paragraph 7 along the lines
of item 1\.

### Committee Response

The Committee believe the specification about composite types is clear enough;
the composite type will be based on "qualified pointer to *type*", and the
`static` keyword (and any size values) are not used.

1. The effect is as if all of the declarations had used `static` and the largest size value used by any of them. Each declaration imposes requirements on all calls to the function in the program; the only way to meet all of these requirements is to always provide pointers to as many objects as the largest such value requires.
2. No.
3. Yes. Visibility is not relevant.
