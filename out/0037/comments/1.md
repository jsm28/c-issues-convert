### Response

The following answers apply (almost) equally to ISO 10646-1 and UNICODE. They
are expressed in terms of ISO 10646-1.

Clause 3, page 2, lines 18-24 and 40-42 define “byte,” “character,” and
“multibyte character” as follows:

**byte**: The unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic
character set of the execution environment.

**character**: A bit representation that fits in a byte. The representation of
each member of the basic character set in both the source and execution
environments shall fit in a byte.

**multibyte character**: A sequence of one or more bytes representing a member
of the extended character set of either the source or the execution environment.
The extended character set is a superset of the basic character set.”

Therefore, if ISO 10646-1 were used as a basic character set, then by definition
a byte would have to be large enough to hold each member of the ISO 10646-1
character set. Also by definition this would make ISO 10646-1 a valid multibyte
character set.

If a byte were only eight bits long, the following answer would hold. ISO
10646-1 represents, in a particular byte order, the character `'a'` for example
as follows.

```c
0 0 0 97
 ---- 16-bit version
 -------- 32-bit version
```

This fails subclause 5.2.1.2, page 11, lines 30-32:

\- A byte with all bits zero shall be interpreted as a null character
independent of shift state.

\- A byte with all bits zero shall not occur in the second or subsequent bytes
of a multibyte character.

Therefore, 8-bit bytes preclude the use of ISO 10646-1 as a multibyte character
set.
