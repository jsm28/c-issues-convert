Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee asserts that the answer to the first question is "yes", an uninitialized value under the conditions described can appear to change its value.
* Since question 2 is applicable, the answer is that any operation performed on indeterminate values will have an indeterminate value as its result.
* The answer to the applicable question 3 is that indeed library functions will exhibit undefined behavior when used on indeterminate values.
* The committee notes that the problem applies to all types that do not have trap representations as per the implementation.
* Strong sentiment formed, in part based on prior experience in developing Annex L, that a new category of "wobbly" value is needed. The underlying issue is that modern compilers track value propagation, and uninitialized values synthesized for an initial use of an object may be discarded as inconsequential prior to synthesizing a different value for a subsequent use. To require otherwise defeats important compiler optimizations. All uses of "wobbly" values might be deemed undefined behavior.
* The principle of Resolution C is desired.
* This requires careful thought.

### Proposed Committee Response

* The answer to question 1 is "yes", an uninitialized value under the conditions described can appear to change its value.
* The answer to question 2 is that any operation performed on indeterminate values will have an indeterminate value as a result.
* The answer to question 3 is that library functions will exhibit undefined behavior when used on indeterminate values.
* These answers are appropriate for all types that do not have trap representations.
* This viewpoint reaffirms the C99 DR260 position.
* The committee agrees that this area would benefit from a new definition of something akin to a "wobbly" value and that this should be considered in any subsequent revision of this standard.
* The committee also notes that padding bytes within structures are possibly a distinct form of "wobbly" representation.
