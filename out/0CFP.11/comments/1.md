### Committee Discussion

The committee agrees that this is a defect and accepts the Suggested Technical
Corrigendum

Apr 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

The paper [N2126](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2126.htm)
provides an example that illustrates this change, and the committee agreed to
accept this as an addendum to the Proposed Technical Corrigendum.

However, the committee is concerned that `%a` behavior differs from binary
floating point and more review is needed. In particular, there were concerns
that for the decimal floating point types now the %a format specifier given with
a precision is the total number of significant digits, not the number of digits
after the decimal point as it has been for other data types.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In 12.5, in the addition to 7.21.6.1#8 and 7.29.2.1#8, under `a`,`A` conversion
specifiers, change:

> If the precision is present (in the conversion specification) and is zero or at
> least as large as the precision *p* (5.2.4.2.2) of the decimal floating type,
> the conversion is as if the precision were missing. If the precision is present
> (and nonzero) and less than the precision *p* of the decimal floating type, the
> conversion first obtains an intermediate result by rounding the input in the
> type, according to the current rounding direction for decimal floating-point
> operations, to the number of digits specified by the precision, then converts
> the intermediate result as if the precision were missing. The length of the
> coefficient of the intermediate result is the smallest number, at least as large
> as the formatting precision, for which the quantum exponent is within the
> quantum exponent range of the type (see 5.2.4.2.2a). The intermediate rounding
> may overflow.

to:

> If the precision *P* is present (in the conversion specification) and is zero or

In 12.5, in the addition to 7.21.6.1#8 and 7.29.2.1#8, in EXAMPLE 3, change the
results:

> ```c
> 9.54321e+93
> 
> 9.5432e+93
> 
> 9.543e+93
> 
> 9.540e+93
> 
> 9.500e+93
> 
> 1.0000e+94
> 
> inf
> ```

to:

> ```c
> 9.54321e+93
> 
> 9.5432e+93
> 
> 9.543e+93
> 
> 9.54e+93
> 
> 9.5e+93
> 
> 1e+94
> 
> 1e+97
> ```

Add, as a new EXAMPLE,

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  _Decimal32 x = 9512345e90df;
  _Decimal32 x2 = 9512345e86df;

  printf("%.3Ha\n", x); // New expected output: 9.51e96
  printf("%.2Ha\n", x); // New expected output: 9.5e96
  printf("%.1Ha\n", x); // New expected output: 1e97
  printf("%.2Ha\n", x2); // New expected output: 9.5e92

  return 0;
}
```
