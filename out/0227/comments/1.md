### Committee Response

The Standard is correct. `tm_year` is provided in the case `%U` and `%W`, to
give freedom to choose the implementation (the output can be determinded using
either `tm_year` or `tm_wday`, along with `tm_yday`). For `%V` it is definitely
required as the computation cannot be made without `tm_year`.
