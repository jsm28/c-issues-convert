Apr 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee’s Proposed Committee Response and Proposed Technical Corrigendum
> from the last meeting was discussed and a new paper
> [N2108](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2108.pdf) by the WG14
> Floating Point study group was written and discussed at some length. After due
> consideration the committee agreed with their conclusion that `DECIMAL_DIG`
> could not in fact be implemented properly, and adopted their Suggested Technical
> Corrigendum below. For reference, the committee's previous direction can be
> found in [N2109](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2109.htm) and
> has been elided in this document.

Oct 2017 meeting

> A proposed change was adopted.

Apr 2018 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> Alternative input to the Proposed Change was presented in paper
> [N2211](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2211.htm) by the C
> Floating Point working group.

> These changes were, however, not reviewed by the Committee.

Oct 2018 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> Alternative input to the Proposed Change was presented in paper
> [N2211](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2211.htm) by the C
> Floating Point working group.
>
> N2108 suggested obsolescing `DECIMAL_DIG`, as part of the resolution of CR 501\.
> This document updates the suggested CR in N2108 to eliminate references in C11
> to `DECIMAL_DIG`, and to clarify. Changes below (along with changes to TS
> 18661\) were identified in N2211.
>
> The Floating Point Study Group was requested to extract the changes for C from
> N2211 and present them separately. This was done and presented (without change)
> in paper [N2253](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2253.pdf) and
> these changes were accepted by the committee as the proposed resolution to this
> issue.

### Proposed Change

In 7.31, add a subclause:

> **7.31.x Mathematics** `<math.h>`
>
> Use of the `DECIMAL_DIG` macro is an obsolescent feature. A similar
> type-specific macro, such as `LDBL_DECIMAL_DIG` can be used instead.

In 5.2.4.2.2#11, in the bullet defining `DECIMAL_DIG`, attach a footnote to the
wording:

> ```c
> DECIMAL_DIG
> ```

where the footnote is:

> \*) See ‘‘future library directions’’ (7.31.x).

In 5.2.4.2.2#14, change:

>  \[14\] Conversion from (at least) `double` to decimal with `DECIMAL_DIG` digits
> and back should be the identity function.

to:

> \[14\] Conversion between real floating type and decimal character sequence with
> at most *T*`_DECIMAL_DIG` digits should be correctly rounded, where *T* is the
> macro prefix for the type. This assures conversion from real floating type to
> decimal character sequence with *T*`_DECIMAL_DIG` digits and back, using
> to-nearest rounding, is the identity function.

In 5.2.4.2.2#16, in the list of macro values in EXAMPLE 2, omit:

> ```c
> DECIMAL_DIG          17
> ```

In 5.2.4.2.2#16, at the end of EXAMPLE 2, omit:

> If a type wider than `double` were supported, then `DECIMAL_DIG` would be
> greater than 17\. For example, if the widest type were to use the minimal-width
> IEC 60559 double-extended format (64 bits of precision), then `DECIMAL_DIG`
> would be 21\.

In 7.21.6.1#13 and 7.29.2.1#13, change:

> \[13\] For `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, and `G` conversions, if the number of
> significant decimal digits is at most `DECIMAL_DIG`, then the result should be
> correctly rounded.283) If the number of significant decimal digits is more than
> `DECIMAL_DIG` but the source value is exactly representable with `DECIMAL_DIG`
> digits, then the result should be an exact representation with trailing zeros.
> Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings *L* \<
> *U*, both having `DECIMAL_DIG` significant digits; the value of the resultant
> decimal string *D* should satisfy *L* ≤ *D* ≤ *U*, with the extra stipulation
> that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

to:

> \[13\] For `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, and `G` conversions, if the number of
> significant decimal digits is at most the maximum value *M* of the
> *T*`_DECIMAL_DIG` macros (defined in `<float.h>`), then the result should be
> correctly rounded.283) If the number of significant decimal digits is more than
> *M* but the source value is exactly representable with *M* digits, then the
> result should be an exact representation with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the
> source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings *L* \< *U*, both having
> *M* significant digits; the value of the resultant decimal string *D* should
> satisfy *L* ≤ *D* ≤ *U*, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a
> correct sign for the current rounding direction.

In 7.22.1.3#9 and 7.29.4.1.1#9, change:

> \[9\] If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most `DECIMAL_DIG`
> (defined in `<float.h>`) significant digits, the result should be correctly
> rounded. If the subject sequence *D* has the decimal form and more than
> `DECIMAL_DIG` significant digits, consider the two bounding, adjacent decimal
> strings *L* and *U*, both having `DECIMAL_DIG` significant digits, such that the
> values of *L*, *D*, and *U* satisfy *L* ≤ *D* ≤ *U*. The result should be one of
> the (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained by correctly rounding *L*
> and *U* according to the current rounding direction, with the extra stipulation
> that the error with respect to *D* should have a correct sign for the current
> rounding direction.294)

to:

> \[9\] If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most *M* significant
> digits, where *M* is the maximum value of the *T*`_DECIMAL_DIG` macros (defined
> in `<float.h>`), the result should be correctly rounded. If the subject sequence
> *D* has the decimal form and more than *M* digits, consider the two bounding,
> adjacent decimal strings *L* and *U*, both having *M* significant digits, such
> that the values of *L*, *D*, and *U* satisfy *L* ≤ *D* ≤ *U*. The result should
> be one of the (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained by correctly
> rounding *L* and *U* according to the current rounding direction, with the extra
> stipulation that the error with respect to *D* should have a correct sign for
> the current rounding direction.294)

In 7.22.1.3 footnote 294 and 7.29.4.1.1 footnote 345, change:

> `DECIMAL_DIG`, defined in `<float.h>`, should be sufficiently large that *L* and
> *U* will usually round to the same internal floating value, but if not will
> round to adjacent values.

to:

> *M* is sufficiently large that *L* and *U* will usually correctly round to the
> same internal floating value, but if not will correctly round to adjacent
> values.

In F.5, omit footnote 361:

> If the minimum-width IEC 60559 extended format (64 bits of precision) is
> supported, `DECIMAL_DIG` shall be at least 21\. If IEC 60559 double (53 bits of
> precision) is the widest IEC 60559 format supported, then `DECIMAL_DIG` shall be
> at least 17\. (By contrast, `LDBL_DIG` and `DBL_DIG` are 18 and 15,
> respectively, for these formats.)

The following change is needed only if TS 18661-1 (with CR 20\) is not
incorporated into C.

In F.5, replace::

> \[1\] Conversion from the widest supported IEC 60559 format to decimal with
> **DECIMAL\_DIG** digits and back is the identity function.361)
>
> \[2\] Conversions involving IEC 60559 formats follow all pertinent recommended
> practice. In particular, conversion between any supported IEC 60559 format and
> decimal with `DECIMAL_DIG` or fewer significant digits is correctly rounded
> (honoring the current rounding mode), which assures that conversion from the
> widest supported IEC 60559 format to decimal with `DECIMAL_DIG` digits and back
> is the identity function.

with:

> \[1\] Conversions involving IEC 60559 formats follow all pertinent recommended
> practice. Conversion between any supported IEC 60559 format and decimal
> character sequence with *M* or fewer significant digits is correctly rounded
> (honoring the current rounding mode), where *M* is the maximum value of the
> *T*`_DECIMAL_DIG` macros (defined in `<float.h>`). Conversion from any supported
> IEC 60559 format to decimal character sequence with at least *T*`_DECIMAL_DIG`
> digits (for the corresponding *type*) and back, using to-nearest rounding, is
> the identity function.

and renumber the subsequent paragraph.
