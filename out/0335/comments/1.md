### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

### Committee Discussion (for history only)

#### Spring 2007

The width of a `_Bool` bit-field is at most the implementation defined width of
the type `_Bool`. A `_Bool` bit-field has the semantics of a `_Bool` (and not an
`unsigned int`).

#### Spring 2008

6.7.2.1 paragraph 3 covers the above Committee discussion. (9899:1999 \+ TC1 \+
TC 2 \+ TC3)

> The expression that specifies the width of a bit-field shall be an integer
> constant expression with a nonnegative value that does not exceed the width of
> an object of the type that would be specified were the colon and expression
> omitted.

Therefore the width of a `_Bool` bit-field is at most the implementation-defined
width of the type `_Bool`.

### Committee Response

6.2.5 paragraph 6 states that

> The type `_Bool` and the unsigned integer types that correspond to the standard
> signed integer types are the standard unsigned integer types.

In other words, `_Bool` is one of the unsigned integer types whether it is used
in a bit-field or not. 6.3.1.2p1 explicitly defines the semantics of `_Bool`,
which are different from other unsigned integer types.

A `_Bool` bit-field has the semantics of a `_Bool` (and not `unsigned int`).

6.7.2.1 paragraph 3 (9899:1999 \+ TC1 \+ TC 2 \+ TC3) states that

> The expression that specifies the width of a bit-field shall be an integer
> constant expression with a nonnegative value that does not exceed the width of
> an object of the type that would be specified were the colon and expression
> omitted.

The width of a `_Bool` bit-field is at most the implementation-defined width of
the type `_Bool`.
