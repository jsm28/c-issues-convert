### Response

The issue is that in

```c
enum {r,w,b} x;
```

and

```c
some-int-type x;
```

where `some-int-type` happens to be the type that by subclause 6.5.2.2, page 61,
line 40 is compatible with the type of the `enum`, what is the resultant
composite type?

Subclause 6.1.2.6 on page 25, lines 11-12 says “*a* type that ... satisfies the
following conditions” (added emphasis on “*a*”). The composite type of two
compatible types is not necessarily unique. In this case both the `enum` type
and the `some-int-type` satisfy the definition of “composite” type. This refutes
the claim that the “composite type is not defined;” the point is that the
standard does not guarantee a *unique* composite type.

As an example, in the following declarations:

```c
enum {r, w, b} x;
 some_int_type x;
```

provided the enumeration type is compatible with the type of `some_int_typ e`,
it is unspecified whether the composite type of `x` is the enumeration type or
`some_int_type`.
