Problem: TR 18037 requires that overflow handling be done before rounding, which
causes problems for alternative overflow modes such as modular wraparound. (When
the overflow mode is saturation, the order in which rounding and overflow
handling are performed has no effect on the end-result.)

Solution: Specify that rounding should be done before overflow handling.

Changes:

* Clause 4.1.3, para 3: strike '(after any overflow handling)'.
* Replacement text for 5.2.4.2.3:
  + Replace in para 6 (staring with 'If the result type of an arithmetic operation') the text 'and then overflow handling and rounding' by 'and then rounding and overflow handling'
  + Strike from para 9 (starting with 'If (after any overflow handling)') the text '(after any overflow handling)'
