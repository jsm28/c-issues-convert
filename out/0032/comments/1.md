### Response

No, a conforming implementation may not accept this example without issuing a
diagnostic. Constraint violations always require a diagnostic (subclause
5.1.1.3). The intent of the statement “An implementation may accept other forms
of constant expressions” (subclause 6.4) is to allow an implementation to accept
syntactic forms, such as might be generated by the `offsetof` macro, that may
not otherwise be semantically allowed.
