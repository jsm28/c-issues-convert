What is an iteration control structure or selection control structure?

An “iteration control structure,” a term used in subclause 5.2.4.1 **Translation
limits** on page 13, line 1, is not defined by the standard.

Is it:

1. A `for` loop header excluding its body, e.g. `for (;;)`,

   or
2. A `for` loop header plus its body, e.g. `for (;;) {}`?

Does it make a difference if the compound statement is a simple statement
without the braces?
