### Committee Discussion

The committee has deliberated and decided that more than one interpretation is
reasonable. Translation limits do not apply to objects whose size is determined
at runtime.

The program is not strictly conforming because it exceeds an environmental
limit.   
If the implementation generates code, there is no requirement for a diagnostic.
In the event that `sizeof` is called on the object, a diagnostic should be
issued, but not required.   
VLAs are a special case.
