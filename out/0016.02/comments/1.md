### Correction

***In subclause 6.5.7, page 71, line 41 through page 72, line 2, change:***

If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly, it
is initialized implicitly as if every member that has arithmetic type were
assigned 0 and every member that has pointer type were assigned a null pointer
constant.

***to:***

1. If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly, then:
2. if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer;
3. if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to zero;
4. if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules;
5. if it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules.
