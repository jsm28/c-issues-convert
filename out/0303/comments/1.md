### Committee Response

TC2 (and specifically [DR 250](issue:0250)) changed that sentence into a
definition.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change 6.10p2:

> A *preprocessing directive* consists of a sequence of preprocessing tokens
> <del>that begins with</del> <ins>that satisfies the following constraints. The
> first token in the sequence is</ins> a `#` preprocessing token that (at the
> start of translation phase 4\) is either the first character in the source file
> (optionally after white space containing no new-line characters) or that follows
> white space containing at least one new-line character<del>, and is ended by the
> next</del> <ins>. The last token in the sequence is the first</ins> new-line
> character <ins>that follows the first token in the
> sequence</ins>.<sup>140\)</sup> A new-line character ends the preprocessing
> directive even if it occurs within what would otherwise be an invocation of a
> function-like macro.
