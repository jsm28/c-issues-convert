### Committee Response

TC2 (and specifically [DR 250](issue:0250)) changed that sentence into a
definition.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change 6.10p2:

> A *preprocessing directive* consists of a sequence of preprocessing tokens
> ~~that begins with~~ <u>that satisfies the following constraints. The first
> token in the sequence is</u> a `#` preprocessing token that (at the start of
> translation phase 4\) is either the first character in the source file
> (optionally after white space containing no new-line characters) or that follows
> white space containing at least one new-line character~~, and is ended by the
> next~~ <u>. The last token in the sequence is the first</u> new-line character
> <u>that follows the first token in the sequence</u>.<sup>140\)</sup> A new-line
> character ends the preprocessing directive even if it occurs within what would
> otherwise be an invocation of a function-like macro.
