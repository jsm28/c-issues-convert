### Response

First of all, no constraints are violated. Therefore, no diagnostics are
required.

Declarations 1, 2, and 5 are strictly conforming. Declarations 3, 4, and 6 are
not, and therefore cause undefined behavior.

The struct `S` is an incomplete type (subclause 6.5.2.3, page 62, lines 25-28).
Also, an array of unknown size is an incomplete type (subclause 6.5.4.2, page
67, lines 9-10). Therefore, arrays of either of the above are not strictly
conforming (subclause 6.1.2.5, page 23, lines 23-24). This makes declarations 3,
4, and 6 not strictly conforming. (But an implementation could get it right.)

As an aside, array parameters are adjusted to pointer type (subclause 6.7.1,
page 82, lines 23-24). However, there is nothing to suggest that a
not-strictly-conforming array type can magically be transformed into a strictly
conforming pointer parameter via this rule.

The types in question can be interpreted two different ways. (Array to pointer
conversion can happen as soon as possible or as late as possible.) Hence a
program that uses such a form has undefined behavior.
