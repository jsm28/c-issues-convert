Subclause 6.1.2.4 says:

> An object has a *storage duration* that determines its lifetime. There are two
> storage durations: static and automatic.

To me that clearly excludes heap objects. Is there a Defect Report on that? If
so which one? (I have responses to Defect Report #001 through Defect Report
#059.) If not and something else in the Standard fixes it, can you point out
where?
