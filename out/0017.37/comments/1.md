### Correction

***In subclause 6.3.2.2, page 40, line 35, change:***

The value of the function call expression is specified in 6.6.6.4.

***to:***

If the expression that denotes the called function has type pointer to function
returning an object type, the function call expression has the same type as that
object type, and has the value determined as specified in 6.6.6.4. Otherwise,
the function call has type `void`.
