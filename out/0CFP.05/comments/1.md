### Committee Discussion

The committee agrees that this is a defect and accepts the Suggested Technical
Corrigendum

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In Clause 8, to the text for C F.3#3:

> \[3] Whether C assignment (6.5.16) (and conversion as if by assignment) to the
> same format is an IEC 60559 convertFormat or copy operation is
> implementation-defined, even if `<fenv.h>` defines the macro
> `FE_SNANS_ALWAYS_SIGNAL` (F.2.1).

append the sentence:

> If the return expression of a `return` statement is evaluated to the
> floating-point format of the return type, it is implementation-defined whether a
> convertFormat operation is applied to the result of the return expression.”

At the end of Clause 8, add:

> In F.3#3, attach a footnote to the wording:
> 
> > Whether C assignment (6.5.16) (and conversion as if by assignment) to the same
> > format is an IEC 60559 convertFormat or copy operation
> 
> where the footnote is:
> 
> \*) Where the source and destination formats are the same, convertFormat
> operations differ from copy operations in that convertFormat operations raise
> the “invalid” floating-point exception on signaling NaN inputs and do not
> propagate non-canonical encodings.
