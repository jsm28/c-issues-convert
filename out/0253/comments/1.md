### Committee Response

Given the example

```c
   struct fred
    {
        char s [6];
        int n;
    };
    struct fred y [] = { { { "abc" }, 1 }, [0] = { .s[0] = 'q' } };
```

6.7.8#21 makes it clear already that `{ .s[0] = 'q' }` initializes a whole
object of type "struct fred" whose members (other than `s[0]`) are initialized
as though they were static storage, so this initialization of `y[0]` overrides
the previous one. Thus, all subobjects of `y[0]` other than `s[0]` are zeroed.
Paragraph #21 of 6.7.8 also makes it clear that the initializations for `x` and
`y` are different.

### Committee Discussion

The tem "designated initializer" is never mentioned in the Standard though it
appears in the index and new features section (the Standard uses the term
"designation initializer" in the text).
