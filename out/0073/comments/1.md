### Response

Lines A, B, C. The identifier `array` points to an object that is not large
enough to hold two `struct complex` objects. The dot selection operator is at
liberty to require the complete structure denoted by its left hand side to be
accessed. Such an access would result in undefined behavior.

Line D. If `array` is regarded as pointing to a single structure then creating a
pointer to one past the end of that object is permitted.

Line E. If `array` is regarded as pointing to a single structure then creating a
pointer two past the end of that object is not permitted. Since there is
insufficient storage allocated to create a second `struct complex` object, it is
not permitted to point one past this partial `struct complex` object.

Lines F, G, H. Same analysis as Lines A, B, C.

Lines I, J, K, L, M, N. All of these calculations will result in pointers that
point outside the original object (arrays or structures) and result in undefined
behavior.
