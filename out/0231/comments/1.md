### Committee Response

The standard is correct, but provide the following words with the response, and
include them in the Rationale document:

> Neither *text-line* nor *non-directive* is implementation defined. They are
> strictly defined as sequences of *pp-tokens* followed by *new-line*. Each of
> these rules represents a placeholder for an intermediate state in the phases of
> translation, and is expressed as a non-terminal since it has no associated
> semantics at this phase.  
> 
> However, these sequences of *pp-tokens* are still subject to normal processing
> in the subsequent phases of translation.
