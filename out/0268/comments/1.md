### Committee Discussion

While we agree that this may be a defect, we are not happy with the proposed
words, and processing this defect is postponed pending improved wording.
Specifically, "as if the body were entered in the normal way" raises a few new
questions.

### Technical Corrigendum

Append to 6.8.5#4:

> The repetition occurs regardless of whether the loop body is entered from the
> iteration statement or by a jump.<sup>\*</sup>
> 
> <sup>\*</sup> Code jumped over is not executed. In particular, the controlling
> expression of a `for` or `while` statement is not evaluated before entering the
> loop body, nor is *clause-1* of a `for` statement.
