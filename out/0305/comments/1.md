### Committee Response

It is clear from the standard (in particular, the phases of translation) that
there are not yet any keywords at the point in question.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change the following sentence in 6.10.1p3:

> After all replacements due to macro expansion and the `defined` unary operator
> have been performed, all remaining identifiers <u>(including those lexically
> identical to keywords)</u> are replaced with the pp-number `0`, and then each
> preprocessing token is converted into a token.
