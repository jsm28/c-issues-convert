### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

### Committee Discussion (for history only)

#### Spring 2007

There seem to be consensus that the comparison functions are under-specified.

The Standard currently says:

> In the synopses in this subclause, real-floating indicates that the argument
> shall be an expression of real floating type.

This is well defined, see 6.2.5 para 10\. However, several in attendance believe
there should be explicit language explaining whether or not the two arguments to
a comparison macro must be the same real-floating type or allowed to be
different real-floating type.

#### Fall 2007

It as also asked for the following to be added to the committee discussion:

> IEEE-754 (and IEEE-754R) require that comparison operations work in all
> supported formats, even if the operands' format differ. C99\+TC1\+TC2, Annex
> F.3, printed page 445, first bullet says that the comparison macros (along with
> the relational and equality operators) are the IEC 60559 comparisons.

#### Spring 2008

This work could possibly fit into the *type generic/overloading* project that
needs to be completed for C1X.

### Committee Response

This issue will be addressed in a future revision of the C standard. See WG 14
document N**xxx**.
