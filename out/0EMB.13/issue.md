Problem: TR 18037 does not alter the definition of integer constant expression
in para 6 of 6.6.

Solution: This is an oversight which, for consistency reasons, should be
corrected.

Change: Add new replacement text for 6.6 to change the first sentence of para 6
as follows: insert before 'and floating' the text 'fixed-point constants that
are the immediate operand of casts'
