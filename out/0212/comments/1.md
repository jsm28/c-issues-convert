### Committee Response

The consensus is that a programmer can put an `mbstate_t` object in the initial
conversion state *for any sequence* by the assignment:

> ```c
> static mbstate_t init_state = {0};
> ```
> 
> *...*
> 
> ```c
> mbstate_t mystate = init_state;
> ```

This technique is used and is believed it to be portable.

There is concern about over specifying the behavior of streams. The Committee
believes that to say that the state becomes unbound at EOF, would cause problems
with a read/write stream that later gets extended. The Committee could not find
a valid reason to hamstring the reader just because it reached an interim EOF.
Moreover, is is unlikely one can portably `fsetpos()` in a wide stream except to
the beginning or to a point that was earlier memorized with an `fgetpos()`. In
either case, there is an obvious state to restore. Old fashioned
`seek()`/`tell()` logic just doesn't full fill the requirements for a wide
stream.

The Committee believes that real implementations and real applications do in
fact support streams that do not begin in the initial state, as well as streams
that do not end in the initial state.

It was also pointed out that even with the suggested text that required a file
to begin in the initial shift state, there was no stated requirement that
`fopen` initialize the associated `mbstate_t` object to have the initial shift
state (which again, would break existing implementations that support files that
do not begin in the initial shift state).

There is no consensus to make this change or any change along this line.
