### Committee Discussion (for history only)

Result does not mean the same as value. This is undefined because 6.5.6#8 has a
'shall' in it. The bits have to stay the same. 6.4.2 applies.

A bit pattern \+ type does not imply a unique value. There can be more than one
bit pattern that represents the same value. C only requires that an object with
a determinate value retain that value during its lifetime unless a an explicit
action (assignment, increment, decrement or through such functions as `memcpy`
and `memmove`) change that value to another one or renders the value
indeterminate.

An indeterminate value may be represented by any bit pattern. The C Standard
lays down no requirement that two inspections of the bits representing a given
value will observe the same bit-pattern only that the observed pattern on each
occasion will be a valid representation of the value.

In addition the C Standard does not prohibit an implementation from tracking the
provenance of the bit-pattern representing a value. An indeterminate value
happening to have a bit pattern that is identical to a bit pattern representing
a determinate value is not sufficient to allow access to the indeterminate value
free from undefined behavior.

In reaching our response we noted that requiring immutable bit patterns for
indeterminate values would reduce optimization opportunities. For example, it
would require tracking of the actual bit-patterns of indeterminate values if the
memory containing them were paged out. That seems an unnecessary constraint on
optimizers with no compensatory benefit to programmers.

### Committee Response

Question 1:

> Values may have any bit-pattern that validly represents them and the
> implementation is free to move between alternate representations (for example,
> it may normalize pointers, floating-point representations etc.). In the case of
> an indeterminate value all bit-patterns are valid representations and the actual
> bit-pattern may change without direct action of the program.

Question 2:

> If two objects have identical bit-pattern representations and their types are
> the same they may still compare as unequal (for example if one object has an
> indeterminate value) and if one is an indeterminate value attempting to read
> such an object invokes undefined behavior. Implementations are permitted to
> track the origins of a bit-pattern and treat those representing an indeterminate
> value as distinct from those representing a determined value. They may also
> treat pointers based on different origins as distinct even though they are
> bitwise identical.

Note that using assignment or bitwise copying via `memcpy` or `memmove` of a
determinate value makes the destination acquire the same determinate value.
