### Committee Discussion

> The committee agrees with the authors’ interpretation and accepts their

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

> The `cnd_timedwait` function atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by `mtx`
> and endeavors to block until the condition variable pointed to by `cond` is
> signaled by a call to `cnd_signal` or to `cnd_broadcast`, or until after the
> `TIME_UTC`-based calendar time pointed to by `ts`.
