### Response

When the last paragraph of subclause 6.1.4 refers to “string literals” it is
referring to the static arrays created in translation phase 7 as specified in
the previous paragraph. Although the current wording of the C Standard may imply
that only completely identical arrays need not be distinct, this was not the
Committee's intent.

### Correction

***In subclause 6.1.4, page 31, change the last paragraph of Semantics (before
the Example) from:***

Identical string literals of either form need not be distinct. If the program
attempts to modify a string literal of either form, the behavior is undefined.

***to:***

These arrays need not be distinct provided their elements have the appropriate
values. If the program attempts to modify such an array, the behavior is
undefined.
