### Response

A directive composed of one or more white-space characters can successfully
match zero white-space characters in the input stream. The paragraphs that
intervene between your two quotations make clear that the second paragraph
applies only to a directive that is a conversion specification.

Thus, both examples should assign 2 to `numAssigned`.
