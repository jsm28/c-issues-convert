### Technical Corrigendum:

In 6.4.1 append to paragraph 2:

> The keyword `_Imaginary` is reserved for specifying imaginary
> types.<sup>footnote</sup>
> 
> <sup>footnote</sup>One possible specification for imaginary types is Annex G.

In 6.7.2 delete "`_Imaginary`" from paragraph 1, delete the cases:

* `float _Imaginary`
* `double _Imaginary`
* `long double _Imaginary`

from paragraph 2, and change paragraph 3 to read:

> \[#3] The type specifier `_Complex` shall not be used if the implementation does
> not provide complex types.<sup>101</sup>

Change footnote 101 to read:

> <sup>101</sup>Freestanding implementations are not required to provide complex
> types.

In 7.3.1 replace paragraphs 3 to 5 with:

> \[#3] The macro
> 
> > ```c
> > I
> > ```
> 
> expands to `_Complex_I`.<sup>162</sup>
> 
> \[#4] Notwithstanding the provisions of subclause 7.1.3, a program may undefine
> and perhaps then redefine the macros `complex` and `I`.

Add a new paragraph to the start of G.2:

> \[#0] There is a new keyword `_Imaginary`, which is used to specify imaginary
> types. It is used as a type-specifier within declaration-specifiers in the same
> way as `_Complex` is (thus "`_Imaginary float`" is a valid type name).

Replace G.6 paragraph 1 with:

> \[#1] The macro
> 
> > ```c
> > imaginary
> > ```
> 
> and
> 
> > ```c
> > _Imaginary_I
> > ```
> 
> are defined, respectively, as `_Imaginary` and a constant expression of type
> `const float _Imaginary` with the value of the imaginary unit. The macro
> 
> > ```c
> > I
> > ```
> 
> is defined to be `_Imaginary_I` (not `_Complex_I` as stated in 7.3).
> Notwithstanding the provisions of 7.1.3, a program may undefine and then perhaps
> redefine the macro `imaginary`.
