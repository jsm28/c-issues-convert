### Response

No. In subclause 7.9.9.1, subclause 7.9.9.3, and subclause 7.9.9.4, the words
“returns ... and stores an implementation-defined positive value in `errno`” do
not imply any temporal ordering. There are implementations that may perform
these operations in either order and they still meet the standard.
