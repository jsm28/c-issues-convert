### Response

Subclause 6.5.4.3, page 67, line 37 and page 68, line 1 state, “The special case
of `void` as the only item in the list specifies that the function has no
parameters.” Therefore, in the case of `f2(void);` there are *no* parameters
just as there are none for `f2();`. Since both functions have the same return
type, these declarations *are* compatible.
