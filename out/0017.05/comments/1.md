### Response

The values of octal or hexadecimal escape sequences are well defined and not
mapped. For instance, the value of the constant `'\x123'` has the value 291\.

The mapping described in subclause 6.1.3.4 on page 28, lines 35-39 applies only
to members of the source character set, of which octal and hexadecimal escape
sequences clearly are not members.

The constraint in subclause 6.1.3.4 on page 29, lines 24-25 will be violated
only if the implementation uses characters of eight bits.

The text of the example in subclause 6.1.3.4 on page 30, lines 8-10 is slightly
opaque, but the parenthesized comment is meant to be subject to the words “Even
if eight bits are used ...” The value is implementation-defined only in that the
implementation specifies how many bits are used for characters and whether type
`char` is signed or not.

This example could be worded a little more clearly to indicate what is
implementation-defined about the constant, and that it “violates the above
constraint” only if eight bits are used for objects that have type `char`, but
we believe that this interpretation is consistent with the intent of the
Committee, and that a reasonable reading of the standard supports this
interpretation.
