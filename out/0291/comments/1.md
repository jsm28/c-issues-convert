### Committee Discussion

The intent of Annex F is to *require* the `rint` functions to raise inexact if
the result differs from the argument value. This is in contrast to the weaker
clause 7 statement that the `rint` functions *may* raise inexact. Moreover,
`nextafter` has the behavior suggested by IEC 60559 and thus should not be
changed. With these changes, the suggested changes are acceptable.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change F.9, paragraph 8 from:

> Whether or when the trigonometric, hyperbolic, base-*e* exponential, base-*e*
> logarithmic, error, and log gamma functions raise the "inexact" floating-point
> exception is implementation-defined. For other functions, the inexact
> floating-point exception is raised whenever the rounded result is not identical
> to the mathematical result.

to:

> Whether or when library functions raise the inexact floating-point exception is
> unspecified, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

Change F.9, paragraph 9 from:

> Whether the inexact floating-point exception can be raised when the rounded
> result actually does equal the mathematical result is implementation-defined.
> Whether the underflow (and inexact) floating-point exception can be raised when
> a result is tiny but not inexact is implementation-defined.(312) Otherwise, as
> implied by F.7.6, the `<math.h>` functions do not raise spurious floating-point
> exceptions (detectable by the user).

to:

> Whether or when library functions raise an undeserved underflow floating-point
> exception is unspecified.(312) Otherwise, as implied by F.7.6, the `<math.h>`
> functions do not raise spurious floating-point exceptions (detectable by the
> user), other than the inexact floating-point exception.

Change Footnote 312 from:

> It is intended that undeserved underflow and inexact floating-point exceptions
> are raised only if determining inexactness would be too costly.

to:

> It is intended that undeserved underflow and inexact floating-point exceptions
> are raised only if avoiding them would be too costly.

Change F.9, paragraph 10 from:

> Whether the functions honor the rounding direction mode is
> implementation-defined.

to:

> Whether the functions honor the rounding direction mode is
> implementation-defined, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

Remove J.3.1.2 (from implementation-defined behavior):

> Whether or when the trigonometric, hyperbolic, base-e exponential, base-e
> logarithmic, error, and log gamma functions raise the inexact floating-point
> exception in an IEC 60559 conformant implementation (F.9).
