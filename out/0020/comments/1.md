### Response

Yes, a compiler that allows the Relaxed Ref/Def model can be standard
conforming. (In this case, the model permits two tentative definitions for `age`
in two translation units to resolve to a single definition at link time.) See
subclause 6.7, page 81, lines 23-25. The code is conforming but not strictly
conforming. The behavior is undefined.
