### Response

The relevant citations are subclause 6.8.6:

> A ... `pragma` ... causes the implementation to behave in an
> implementation-defined manner.

and clause 4:

> A strictly conforming program ... shall not produce output dependent on any ...
> implementation-defined behavior ...

In response to each question:

1. Yes, a conforming implementation may define and recognize a pragma which would change the semantics of the language.
2. Yes, for example, it might honor `UNSIGNED_PRESERVING`.
3. No, a strictly conforming program may not contain a pragma directive.
4. We agree with your conclusion, reasserting answer number 3\.
