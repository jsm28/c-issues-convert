### Response

No change is necessary, because subclause 6.1.2.3 (second item) states that name
spaces of tags are shared. Therefore the inner `enum TAG` hides the outer
`struct TAG`, and therefore the cast `(struct TAG *)` attempts to declare a new
`struct TAG`, thus violating a constraint in subclause 6.5.

A conforming implementation need not translate the given code.
