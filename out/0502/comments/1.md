### Committee Discussion

> After further discussion and review, the committee does not support the
> interpretation that ยง6.7.2.1 paragraph 13 overrides the paragraph 18\.

### Proposed Committee Response

> The committee does not support the interpretation that ยง6.7.2.1 paragraph 13
> overrides the paragraph 18\. No struct or union, even anonymous, should have a
> size of zero, and since the effect desired is easily achieved, there is no
> motivation for creating a second mechanism to achieve that purpose.
