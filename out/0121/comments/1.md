### Response

The “size required” is that required by the implementation. The words “If the
space provided is not long enough” make it clear that it is the size of the type
that is relevant, and means that any type that is at least as long as the type
of the “size required” is also acceptable. The size required need not be related
to the result of `sizeof` applied to the expression.
