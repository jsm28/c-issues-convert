### Response

Subclause 6.3.2.1 describes limitations on pointer arithmetic, in connection
with array subscripting. (See also subclause 6.3.6.) Basically, it permits an
implementation to tailor how it *represents pointers* to the size of the objects
they point at. Thus, the expression `p->x[5]` may fail to designate the expected
byte, even though the `malloc` call ensures that the byte is present. The idiom,
while common, is *not* strictly conforming.

A safer idiom is:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
 #define HUGE_ARR	10000	/* largest desired array */

 struct A {
        char x[HUGE_ARR];
        };

 main()
        {
        struct A *p = (struct A *) malloc(sizeof(struct A)
 		- HUGE_ARR + 100);	/* want x[100] this time */
 	p->x[5] = '?';		/* now strictly conforming */
        return 0;
        }
```
