### Summary

C11 seems to have inherited part of a joke from C\+\+, which ought to be removed
or made whole and annotated as such. Originally, C\+\+0x had the footnotes:

> "Atomic objects are neither active nor radioactive" and "Among other
> implications, atomic variables shall not decay".

The first is pretty clearly a joke, but it's not obvious that the second doesn't
have some technical meaning, and that is the one that remains in C11 in
7.17.3p13.

### Suggested Technical Corrigendum

See above.
