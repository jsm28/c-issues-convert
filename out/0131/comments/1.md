### Response

The example code is *not* strictly conforming, because some objects (the
elements of the array `s1.a`) are being modified through use of an lvalue (`s1`)
with non-const-qualified type, which according to subclause 6.5.3 results in
undefined behavior.

However, a diagnostic is indeed desired here.

### Correction

***In subclause 6.2.2.1, page 36, change the parenthetic remark in the final
sentence of the first paragraph:***

(including, recursively, any member of all contained structures or unions)

***to:***

(including, recursively, any member or element of all contained aggregates or
unions)
