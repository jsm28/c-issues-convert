### Committee Discussion

The Committee believes that the Constraint in 6.4.4 applies, and that a constant
must have a type. If a type cannot be assigned, the program is invalid and
violates the Constraint.

The second part involves `uint64_c`. The macros were not intended to be very
smart. It is permissible for them to use compiler magic.

### Technical Corrigendum

Change the constraint in 6.4.4 to read:

> Each constant shall have a type and the value of a constant shall be in the
> range of representable values for its type.

Add the following sentence as last sentence of the paragraph after the list in
6.4.4.1:

> If an integer constant cannot be represented by any type in its list and has no
> extended integer type, then the integer constant has no type.

7.18.4, paragraph 2 \- change

> "a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant"

to

> "an unsuffixed integer constant".
