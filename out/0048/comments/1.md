### Response

Does the C Standard either permit or require an implementation to reset an
ignored `SIGABRT` to `SIG_DFL`?

Answer: Yes, it permits it. There is no way to detect such a change in a
strictly conforming program.

Or, does the C Standard permit or require a call similar to
`exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`?

Answer: No. Abnormal termination does not allow calls to the `atexit`-registered
functions.

Does the C Standard? (After all, how can it be tested?)

Answer: No. See above.

And, finally, can a portable application find any utility in setting `SIGABRT`
to `SIG_IGN`?

Answer: Not within the context of `abort`.

We note that therefore there is no clash between Standard C and POSIX.1.
