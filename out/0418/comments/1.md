### Committee Discussion

> * Given that, unless stated otherwise, if the argument is a NaN, the result is a NaN, and there is no floating point exception.
> * The parenthetical comment **might** be causing confusion, and removing it seems to make it more confusing.
> * Adding more explicit wording is possible but seems unnecessary.

### Proposed Committee Response
