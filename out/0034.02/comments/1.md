### Response

The example exhibits undefined behavior. It does not violate a constraint.
Subclause 6.1.2.2, page 21, lines 10-13 describe “same object;” subclause
6.1.2.6, page 25, lines 9-10 require that “All declarations that refer to the
same object or function shall have compatible type; otherwise, the behavior is
undefined.”
