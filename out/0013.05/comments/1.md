### Correction

***Add to subclause 6.5.2.3, page 63, another Example:***

An enumeration type is compatible with some integral type. An implementation may
delay the choice of which integral type until all enumeration constants have
been seen. Thus in:

```c
enum f { c = sizeof(enum f) };
```

the behavior is undefined since the size of the respective enumeration type is
not necessarily known when `sizeof`
