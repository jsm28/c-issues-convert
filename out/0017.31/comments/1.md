### Response

There are numerous places in the standard where “size in bytes” is used, and
numerous places where “size” alone is used. The Committee does not feel that any
of these places need fixing \- the meaning is everywhere clear, especially since
for `sizeof` in subclause 6.3.3.4 size is specifically mentioned in terms of
bytes.
