Oct 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> Discussion with the author clarified these issues, and the paper
> [N1888](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1888.htm) was
> discussed. From that, we extract the following example
> 
> > ```c
> > union u2 {
> >     int x;
> >     long y;
> >     char ca[2];
> > };
> > 
> > int func2(void) {
> >     union u2 o2 = { .ca = "a" };
> > ```
> 
> and question, what is the result of `(0,o2).ca == o2.ca`?
> 
> Given that the comma operator doesn't yield an lvalue (6.5.17), and from 6.2.4p8
> such a non-lvalue expression is stated to have automatic storage duration, this
> seems to require that the answer is false, even though this defeats compiler
> optimizations.
> 
> The effective type rule 6.5.p6 also does not seem to apply to objects with
> temporary lifetime, and has undesirable consequences.
> 
> The direction the committee would like to go is something like:
> 
> In 6.2.4p8, append
> 
> > An object with temporary lifetime behaves as if it had the declared type of its
> > value. Such an object is known as a *temporary object*. A temporary object need
> > not have a unique address.
> 
> Apr 2015 meeting
> 
> ### Committee Discussion
> 
> > The following words were drafted and approved by the committee as the Proposed
> > Technical Corrigendum.
> 
> ### Proposed Committee Response
> 
> > To the question "Should the expression `(O, o2).ca == o2.ca` yield zero,
> > non-zero, or should it be implementation defined?" the answer is "implementation
> > defined".
> > 
> > With the following changes, the effective type of `O, o3` is defined.
> 
> ### Proposed Technical Corrigendum
> 
> In 6.2.4p8, append
> 
> > An object with temporary lifetime behaves as if it were declared with the type
> > of its value for the purposes of effective type. Such an object need not have a
> > unique address.
> > 
> > (add forward reference to 6.5p6 to this section)
