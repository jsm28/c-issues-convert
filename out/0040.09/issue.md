re: UK request for interpretation cai027 ( [Defect Report #017 Question

It has been pointed out, and the UK C panel agreed at its last meeting, that the
request for interpretation was unnecessary. The C Standard was clear and
unambiguous as is.

To make matters worse, X3J11 appears to have given an interpretation that is the
opposite of what the C Standard says.

The UK would like to withdraw this request for interpretation and ask the
Committee to reconsider its position.
