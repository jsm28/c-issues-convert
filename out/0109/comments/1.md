### Response

The C Standard uses the term “indeterminately valued” not “undefined value.” Use
of an indeterminate valued object results in undefined behavior.

The footnote to subclause 5.1.1.3 points out that an implementation is free to
produce any number of diagnostics as long as a valid program is still correctly
translated.

If an expression whose evaluation would result in undefined behavior appears in
a context where a constant expression is required, the containing program is not
strictly conforming. Furthermore, if *every* possible execution of a given
program would result in undefined behavior, the given program is not strictly
conforming.

A conforming implementation must not fail to translate a strictly conforming
program simply because *some* possible execution of that program would result in
undefined behavior. Because `foo` might never be called, the example given must
be successfully translated by a conforming implementation.
