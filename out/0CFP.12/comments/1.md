### Committee Discussion

The committee agrees that this is a defect and accepts the Suggested Technical
Corrigendum

### Proposed Change

In 14.10, replace the first sentence:

> IEC 60559 defines the payload of a NaN to be a certain part of the NaN’s
> significand interpreted as an integer.

with:

> IEC 60559 defines the payload of a NaN to be a certain part of the NaN’s
> significand. The payload can be interpreted as an unsigned integer.

In 14.10, in the new C subclause F.10.13, replace:

> IEC 60559 defines the *payload* of a quiet or signaling NaN as an integer value
> encoded in the significand.

with:

> IEC 60559 defines the *payload* of a quiet or signaling NaN as information
> encoded in part of the NaN significand. The payload can be interpreted as an
> unsigned integer.

In 14.10, in the new C subclauses F.10.13.2#2 and F.10.13.3#2, change:

> If `pl` is not a positive floating-point integer representing a valid payload,
> `*res` is set to positive zero.

to:

> If `pl` is not a floating-point integer representing a valid payload, `*res` is
> set to positive zero.
