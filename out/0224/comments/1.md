### Committee Discussion

This seems clear from a combination of 7.12.3.1 paragraph 2 and 7.12 paragraph
6\.

Don't see what Plauger's comments in regard to `FP_INFINITE` is, and didn't
consider that there is any problem.

### Technical Corrigendum

In 7.12 paragraph #6 a new term "number classification macro" should be
introduced, and the reword the first sentence to:

> The *number classification macros* are:
>
> > ```c
> > FP_INFINITE
> > FP_NAN
> > FP_NORMAL
> > FP_SUBNORMAL
> > FP_ZERO
> > ```
