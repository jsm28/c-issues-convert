### Response

This is a work in progress item.

Summary of Part 1:

The standard does not currently state what happens with relational operators
when you compare the address of an object with a null pointer.

We know from the citation from subclause 6.2.2.3 that a null pointer is
guaranteed to yield false when compared with a pointer to an object.

It is explicitly undefined behaviour to use relational operators on two pointer
that are not members of the same aggregate or union object. However it is
unstated whether a null pointer compares greater or less than the address of an
object and hence is implicitly undefined behaviour.

Is this the desired behaviour?

Note: the current C\+\+ clause has the following wording:

> If two pointers of the same type point to different objects or functions, or
> only one of them is null, they compare unequal.

This wording gives the possibility for C and C\+\+ to give different results.

Summary of Part 2:

Discussion from Nashua is as follows:

The intent is that pointers to distinct object will compare unequal, The C
Standard will be fixed in a future revision.
