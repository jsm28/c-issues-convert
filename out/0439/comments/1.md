Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* These are subtle issues upon which the committee wishes to continue discussing.
* The committee is seeking concurrence with the project editor that Point A may be viewed as editorial.
* To Point B the committee is in agreement that there is a "guarantee" of the distinct values `0`, `1`, and `2`, and that this is not new to C11. The committee requires further discussion as to whether and how these subtleties could be expressed in a non-normative fashion, such as "in the rationale", "in a footnote", or simply as an example.
* To Point C the committee agrees that some change is needed and has solicited a suggested resolution from the author. The fact that VLAs can have several dimensions and hence several expressions gave pause to all.
* To Point D the committee agrees that this has been left undefined and deserves a committee response but no normative or other change.
* To Point E, the committee agreed that the list of full expressions named in 6.8 paragraph 4 second sentence should likely be regarded as non-normative rather than allowing it to appear exhaustive. To achieve this, the list could be transformed into a note or footnote.

Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The paper [N1965](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1965.htm) was submitted and discussed.
* From that, the editorial suggestion from Part A was incorporated into Part C which was approved by the committee as a normative element in the following Proposed Technical Corrigendum, and Part E was approved as a non-normative footnote.
* The Part D section had already met with some some skepticism from the committee and was mostly provided as an idea to consider. Discussion revealed that there are some implementations of VLA that would be broken by this change, and so the committee preferred to not try to address this issue from this DR at this time. Another new paper on this point would be welcomed by the committee.
* The sequencing issues raise in Part B are subtle and the Standard potentially confusing, but there is no reported evidence that this is causing any issues in practice. The new paper offered no Suggested Technical Corrigendum in this area, and the committee did not request further elaboration of what might be needed in this area, and so was content to accept just the changes resolving issues A, C, and E in the following Proposed Technical Corrigendum.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Change 6.2.4p8 sentence 3 from:

> Its lifetime ends when the evaluation of the containing full expression or full
> declarator ends.

to:

> Its lifetime ends when the evaluation of the containing full expression ends.

Delete 6.7.6p3 sentence 2:

> The end of a full declarator is a sequence point.

Change 6.8p4 from:

> A *full expression* is an expression that is not part of another expression, or
> of a declarator. Each of the following is a full expression: an initializer that
> is not part of a compound literal; the expression in an expression statement;
> the controlling expression of a selection statement (`if` or `switch)`; the
> controlling expression of a `while` or `do` statement; each of the (optional)
> expressions of a `for` statement; the (optional) expression in a `return`
> statement. There is a sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression
> and the evaluation of the next full expression to be evaluated.

to:

> A *full expression* is an expression that is not part of another expression, nor
> part of a declarator or abstract declarator. There is also an implicit full
> expression in which the non-constant size expressions for a variably modified
> type are evaluated; within that full expression, the evaluation of different
> size expressions are unsequenced with respect to one another. There is a
> sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression and the evaluation of
> the next full expression to be evaluated.

Add after 6.8p4:

> NOTE: Each of the following is a full expression:
>
> * a full declarator for a variably modified type;
> * an initializer that is not part of a compound literal;
> * the expression in an expression statement;
> * the controlling expression of a selection statement (`if` or `switch)`;
> * the controlling expression of a `while` or `do` statement;
> * each of the (optional) expressions of a `for` statement;
> * the (optional) expression in a `return` statement.
>
> While a constant expression satisfies the definition of a full expression,
> evaluating it does not depend on nor produce any side effects, so the sequencing
> implications of being a full expression are not relevant to a constant
> expression.

Delete the Annex C bullet:

* The end of a full declarator; declarators (6.7.6);

Change the Annex C bullet from:

* Between the evaluation of a full expression and the next full expression to be evaluated. The following are full expressions: an initializer that is not part of a compound literal; the expression in an expression statement; the controlling expression of a selection statement (`if` or `switch)`; the controlling expression of a `while` or `do` statement; each of the (optional) expressions of a `for` statement; the (optional) expression in a `return` statement.

to:

Between the evaluation of a full expression and the next full expression to be evaluated. The following are full expressions: a full declarator for a variably modified type; an initializer that is not part of a compound literal; the expression in an expression statement; the controlling expression of a selection statement (`if` or `switch)`; the controlling expression of a `while` or `do` statement; each of the (optional) expressions of a `for` statement; the (optional) expression in a `return` statement.
