### Committee Discussion

#### Spring 2007

There was no consensus for question 2\.

For question 1: The Committee believes that 6.9.1 paragraph 9 is a comment on
the storage duration and does not override the lexical scope described in 6.2.1
paragraph 7\.

#### Fall 2007

General consensus is that the wording in the Standard is basically not correct
and needs to be reworked.

#### Spring 2008

#### Question 1

C\+\+ 3.3.2p2 has three sentences (words irrelevant to C are deleted):

1. The potential scope of a function parameter name or of a function-local predefined variable in a function definition begins at its point of declaration.
2. The potential scope of a parameter or of a function-local predefined variable ends at the end of the outermost block of the function definition.
3. A parameter name shall not be redeclared in the outermost block of the function definition.

For sentence 1, 6.2.1p7 already says:

> Any other identifier has scope that begins just after the completion of its
> declarator.

For sentence 2, 6.2.1p4 already says:

> If the declarator or type specifier that declares the identifier appears inside
> a block or within the list of parameter declarations in a function definition,
> the identifier has *block scope*, which terminates at the end of the associated
> block.

For sentence 3, 6.7p3 already says:

> If an identifier has no linkage, there shall be no more than one declaration of
> the identifier (in a declarator or type specifier) with the same scope and in
> the same name space, except for tags as specified in 6.7.2.3.

And 6.2.1p6 says:

> Two identifiers have the *same scope* if and only if their scopes terminate at
> the same point.

So what the C\+\+ standard says, and what the C standard needs to say, about the
scope of a parameter name is already covered in the C standard, outside of
6.9.1p9. Therefore, I suggest modifying 6.9.1p9 as indicated:

> Each parameter has automatic storage duration. Its identifier is an lvalue~~,
> which is in effect declared at the head of the compound statement that
> constitutes the function body (and therefore cannot be redeclared in the
> function body except in an enclosed block)~~. The layout of the storage for
> parameters is unspecified.

Additionally, if desired, add a footnote at the point of the deletion:

> <u>A parameter identifier cannot be redeclared in the function body except in an
> enclosed block.</u>

#### Question 2

The words "a strict subset" are technically incorrect, but nothing really
depends on them. Fixing them can be treated as an editorial matter.

One possibility would be simply to qualify that statement with "generally" or
"usually". The submitter's suggested technical corrigendum would also be
technically correct. In 6.2.1p4:

> ... If an identifier designates two different entities in the same name space,
> the scopes might overlap. If so, the scope of one entity (the *inner scope*)
> will ~~be a strict subset of~~ <u>end strictly before</u> the scope of the other
> entity (the *outer scope*). Within the inner scope, the identifier designates
> the entity declared in the inner scope; the entity declared in the outer scope
> is *hidden* (and not visible) within the inner scope.

**Change for C1X**

Change 6.9.1 paragraph 9 to:

> Each parameter has automatic storage duration. Its identifier is an
> lvalue,<sup>\*</sup> the layout of the storage for parameters is unspecified.
> 
> <sup>\*</sup>A parameter identifier cannot be redeclared in the function body
> except in an enclosed block.

Change 6.2.1 paragraph 4 to:

> ... If an identifier designates two different entities in the same name space,
> the scopes might overlap. If so, the scope of one entity (the *inner scope*)
> will end strictly before the scope of the other entity (the *outer scope*).
> Within the inner scope, the identifier designates the entity declared in the
> inner scope; the entity declared in the outer scope is *hidden* (and not
> visible) within the inner scope.
