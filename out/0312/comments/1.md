### Committee Discussion (for history only)

The statement, "Suppose the implementation does not accept any non-standard
forms of constant expressions under 6.6#10, so that `(int)+1.0` is an arithmetic
constant expression but not an integer constant expression." , implies an
interpretation of the standard that the implementation can extend the meaning of
what constitutes an integer constant expression. For example, that `(int)+1.0`
is an integer constant expression.

The committee does not believe that it does. Even if an implementation accepts
other forms of constant expressions, paragraph 6.6#10 does not change the
definition of an integer constant expression given by paragraph 6.6#6, and
`int[(int)+1.0]` is still a VLA.

Paragraph 6.6#10 cannot be used to get around issuing diagnostics for constraint
violations where integer constant expressions are required. Which we believe is
what the first paragraph of the introductory text is implying

### Technical Corrigendum

Add to 6.2.5, after Paragraph 22

> A type has *known constant size* if the type is not incomplete and is not a
> variable length array type.
