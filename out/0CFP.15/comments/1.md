### Committee Discussion

The committee agreed with this issue and its proposed clarification.

**Proposed Technical Clarification**

In TS 18661-3 5.3, in the text for 5.2.4.2.2#6c, after the list for supported
types `_Float`*`N`*, insert:

> for IEC 60559 non-arithmetic binary interchange formats of width *N*:
>
> `FLT`*N*`_DECIMAL_DIG     FLT`*N*`_DIG`

In TS 18661-3 clause 7, in the text for 5.2.4.2.2a#1, change:

> The prefix `FLT`*N*`_` indicates a binary interchange floating type of width
> *N*.

to:

> The prefix `FLT`*N*`_` indicates a binary interchange floating type or a
> non-arithmetic binary interchange format of width *N*.

Change the last sentence of  5.2.4.2.2a#1 from:

> Conversely, for each such type that the implementation does not provide,
> `<float.h>` shall not define the associated macros in the following lists.

to:

> Conversely, for each such type that the implementation does not provide,
> `<float.h>` shall not define the associated macros in the following list,
> except, the implementation shall define the macros `FLT`*N*`_DECIMAL_DIG` and
> `FLT`*N*`_DIG` if it supports IEC 60559 non-arithmetic binary interchange
> formats of width *N* by providing the encoding-to-encoding conversion functions
> in `<math.h>` and the string-to-encoding and string-from-encoding functions in
> `<stdlib.h>`.
