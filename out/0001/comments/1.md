### Correction

***In subclause 6.6.6.4, page 80, lines 30-32, replace:***

If the expression has a type different from that of the function in which it
appears, it is converted as if it were assigned to an object of that type.

***with:***

If the expression has a type different from the return type of the function in
which it appears, the value is converted as if by assignment to an object having
the return type of the function.**\***

\[Footnote \*: The `return` statement is not an assignment. The overlap
restriction in subclause 6.3.16.1 does not apply to the case of function
return.\]

***Add to subclause 6.6.6.4, page 80:***

**Example**

In:

```c
struct s {double i;} f(void);
 union {struct {int f1;
                struct s f2;} u1;
        struct {struct s f3;
                int f4;} u2;
       } g;
 struct s f(void)
         {
         return g.u1.f2;
         }
 /* ... */
 g.u2.f3 = f();
```

the behavior is defined.
