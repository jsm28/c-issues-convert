### Committee Discussion

> A spurious failure can occur on PPC/ARM style architectures if, after the
> load-word-and-reserve instruction is issued the operating system schedules the
> task out, and upon resumption the corresponding store-word fails because the
> reservation is lost, even if the lock is unlocked. This failure can be seen by
> `mtx_trylock` if it is implemented with `atomic_compare_exchange_weak` where
> this failure can occur.
>
> A new paper was solicited to extract the corresponding words from C\+\+ so as to
> keep the two standards as close as possible in this area.

### Committee Discussion

> The paper [N1922](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1922.pdf)
> was presented and adopted with an editorial improvement.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In 7.26.4.5 replace paragraph 3

> The **mtx\_trylock** function returns **thrd\_success** on success, or
> **thrd\_busy** if the resource requested is already in use, or **thrd\_error**
> if the request could not be honored.

with

> The **mtx\_trylock** function returns **thrd\_success** on success, or
> **thrd\_busy** if the resource requested is already in use, or **thrd\_error**
> if the request could not be honored. **mtx\_trylock** may spuriously fail to
> lock an unused resource, in which case it shall return **thrd\_busy**.
