These changes have been proposed for the C\+\+ working draft:

### Committee Discussion

> A paper [N1856](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1856.htm) was
> provided that discusses the drift between the two Standards and a first cut at
> some possible wording changes, as follows. It was not, however, discussed, but
> does provide insight as to the necessary direction for a resolution to this DR.

1. Change 5.1.2.4 paragraph 22 as follows:

   > ~~The *visible sequence of side effects* on an atomic object *M*, with respect
   > to a value computation *B* of *M*, is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence of side
   > effects in the modification order of M, where the first side effect is visible
   > with respect to *B*, and for every side effect, it is not the case that *B*
   > happens before it.~~ The value of an atomic object *M*, as determined by
   > evaluation *B*, shall be the value stored by some ~~operation in the visible
   > sequence of *M* with respect to *B*~~ <u>side effect *A* that modifies *M*,
   > where *B* does not happen before *A*</u>. \[*Note:* ~~It can be shown that the
   > visible sequence of side effects of a value computation is unique given~~ <u>The
   > set of side effects that a given evaluation might take its value from is also
   > restricted by the rest of the rules described here, and in particular, by</u>
   > the coherence requirements below. —*end note*\]
2. Change 5.1.2.4 paragraph 24 as follows:

   > \[*Note:* The ~~visible sequence of side effects~~ <u>value observed by a load
   > of an atomic</u> depends on the “happens before” relation, which depends on the
   > values observed by loads of atomics~~, which we are restricting here~~. The
   > intended reading is that there must exist an association of atomic loads with
   > modifications they observe that, together with suitably chosen modification
   > orders and the “happens before” relation derived as described above, satisfy the
   > resulting constraints as imposed here. —*end note*\]
3. Change 5.1.2.4 paragraph 27 as follows:

   > \[*Note:* Compiler transformations that introduce assignments to a potentially
   > shared memory location that would not be modified by the abstract machine are
   > generally precluded by this standard, since such an assignment might overwrite
   > another assignment by a different thread in cases in which an abstract machine
   > execution would not have encountered a data race. This includes implementations
   > of data member assignment that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory
   > locations. Reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question
   > may alias is also generally precluded, since this may violate the ~~“visible
   > sequence”~~ <u>coherence</u> rules. —*end note*\]
4. Change 7.17.3 paragraph 6 as follows:

   > There shall be a single total order *S* on all `memory_order_seq_cst`
   > operations, consistent with the “happens before” order and modification orders
   > for all affected locations, such that each `memory_order_seq_cst` operation *B*
   > that loads a value from an atomic object *M* observes one of the following
   > values:
   >
   > * the result of the last modification *A* of *M* that precedes *B* in *S*, if it
   >   exists, or
   > * if *A* exists, the result of some modification of *M* ~~in the visible sequence
   >   of side effects with respect to *B*~~ that is not `memory_order_seq_cst` and
   >   that does not happen before *A*, or
   > * if *A* does not exist, the result of some modification of *M* ~~in the visible
   >   sequence of side effects with respect to *B*~~ that is not
   >   `memory_order_seq_cst`.

   > \[*Note:*...

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Change 5.1.2.4 paragraph 22 from:

> The *visible sequence of side effects* on an atomic object *M*, with respect to
> a value computation *B* of *M*, is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence of side
> effects in the modification order of M, where the first side effect is visible
> with respect to *B*, and for every subsequent side effect, it is not the case
> that *B* happens before it. The value of an atomic object *M*, as determined by
> evaluation *B*, shall be the value stored by some operation in the visible
> sequence of *M* with respect to *B*.

to:

> The value of an atomic object *M*, as determined by evaluation *B*, shall be the
> value stored by some side effect *A* that modifies *M*, where *B* does not
> happen before *A*.

After 5.1.2.4 paragraph 22 add:

> **Note** The set of side effects from which a given evaluation might take its
> value is also restricted by the rest of the rules described here, and in
> particular, by the coherence requirements below.

Change 5.1.2.4 paragraph 24 from:

> **Note 11:** The visible sequence of side effects depends on the “happens
> before” relation, which in turn depends on the values observed by loads of
> atomics, which we are restricting here. The intended reading is that there must
> exist an association of atomic loads with modifications they observe that,
> together with suitably chosen modification orders and the “happens before”
> relation derived as described above, satisfy the resulting constraints as
> imposed here.

> **Note 11:** The value observed by a load of an atomic depends on the “happens

> atomics. The intended reading is that there must exist an association of atomic
> loads with modifications they observe that, together with suitably chosen
> modification orders and the “happens before” relation derived as described
> above, satisfy the resulting constraints as imposed here.

Change 5.1.2.4 paragraph 27 from:

> **Note 13:** Compiler transformations that introduce assignments to a
> potentially shared memory location that would not be modified by the abstract
> machine are generally precluded by this standard, since such an assignment might
> overwrite another assignment by a different thread in cases in which an abstract
> machine execution would not have encountered a data race. This includes
> implementations of data member assignment that overwrite adjacent members in
> separate memory locations. Reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the
> atomics in question may alias is also generally precluded, since this may
> violate the “visible sequence” rules.

Change 7.17.3 paragraph 6 from:

> There shall be a single total order *S* on all `memory_order_seq_cst`
> operations, consistent with the “happens before” order and modification orders
> for all affected locations, such that each `memory_order_seq_cst` operation *B*
> that loads a value from an atomic object *M* observes one of the following
> values:
>
> * the result of the last modification *A* of *M* that precedes *B* in *S*, if it
>   exists, or
> * if *A* exists, the result of some modification of *M* in the visible sequence of
>   side effects with respect to *B* that is not `memory_order_seq_cst` and that
>   does not happen before *A*, or
> * if *A* does not exist, the result of some modification of *M* in the visible
>   sequence of side effects with respect to *B* that is not `memory_order_seq_cst`.
