### Response

The Committee reasserts that the grammar and/or semantics of preprocessing as
they appear in the standard are as intended. We are attaching a copy of the
previous response to this item from David F. Prosser. The Committee endorses the
substance of this response, which follows: The equivalent of your proposal was
rejected a couple of years ago. Certain Committee members felt that requiring
all preprocessors to recognize these lines as directives was too much. Those
that felt that these lines must be recognized were finally convinced that it was
enough to allow implementations the right to behave in the more orthogonal
manner. (Maybe they figure that the next version of the standard will have to
require this sort of behavior, as all “reasonable” implementations already will
have it by then.)
