Oct 2012 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> * This paper is new enough that a thorough examination of its contents has not been made. It is not clear whether it is a DR or a proposal.
> * If implementers do not know what to do, it is a defect.
> * Handling of the atomic type qualifier may be the most likely defect, if there is one.

Apr 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The intent of the Standard is most clearly reflected in the author's Proposal 5\.
* Clark Nelson provided an in-depth analysis of Proposal 5\.
* The suggested changes to 6.5.1.1 are unnecessary. The controlling expression of a generic selection was very carefully *not* added to the list of contexts in which lvalue conversion is not done and type qualification is discarded; see 6.3.2.1p2. As such, the controlling expression of a generic selection can not have qualified type. It was thought that a note to that effect might be useful in 6.5.1.1p3.
* The suggested addition to 6.5.4 is useful, but a better change would be to change 6.5.4p5 to:
  > Preceding an expression by a parenthesized type name converts the value of the
  > expression to <u>the unqualified version</u> of the named type. This
  > construction is called a cast. A cast that specifies no conversion has no effect
  > on the type or value of an expression.
  
  Also, footnote 104 should be reduced to just its first sentence.
* The suggested changes to 6.5.2.2 and 6.7.63p15 are desirable, but a simpler change would be to remove any qualifier from the declared return type of a function. So, in 6.7.6.3p5, change to:
  > and the type specified for *ident* in the declaration "`T D`" is
  > "*derived-declarator-type-list T*", then the type specified for *ident* is
  > "*derived-declarator-type-list* function returning <u>the unqualified version
  > of</u> *T*".
* Atomic types may or may not be subject to distinct generic selection and this needs to be resolved.

Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee notes that in reflector email 13037 (2013-08-13) that the issue w.r.t. atomics applies to casts, and also needs addressing. The standard was thought to be clear that during conversion to non-atomic type that any implementation size differences are resolved to the non-atomic value, and such conversions would be expected for casts. Such does not seem to be the case, however.
* Further refinement of when and where and how to express the treatment of lvalues and non-lvalues has been made. Specifically, the controlling expression of a generic selection "was very carefully not added" to the list of cases where lvalue conversion is not done.
* Specifically, change 6.5.4.p5 to:
  > Preceding an expression by a parenthesized type name converts the value of the
  > expression to the unqualified version of the named type. This construction is
  > called a cast. A cast that specifies no conversion has no effect on the type or
  > value of an expression. (and delete footnote 104\)
* Also, change 6.7.63 paragraph 5:
  > . . . then the type specified for ident is "derived-declaration-type-list
  > function returning the unqualified version of T".
* A paper has been solicited to resolve the atomic issues that would argue that type generic selection should apply distinctly to atomic types, as seems to be the direction sought by the submitter.

Apr 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The proposed resolution found in [N1803](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1803.htm) was withdrawn.
* A paper has been solicited to provide a technical corrigendum. It should reflect that the first sentence of footnote 104, "A cast does not yield an lvalue" should be kept.

Apr 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The paper [N1863](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1863.pdf)
> was provided and its Suggested Technical Suggestion was adopted.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

Change 6.5.4.p5 from

> Preceding an expression by a parenthesized type name converts the value of the
> expression to the named type. This construction is called a
> *cast*<sup>104</sup>. A cast that specifies no conversion has no effect on the
> type or value of an expression.
> 
> 104\) A cast does not yield an lvalue. Thus, a cast to a qualified type has the
> same effect as a cast to the unqualified version of that type.

Change 6.7.6.3 p5 from
