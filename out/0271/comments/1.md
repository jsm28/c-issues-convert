### Committee Response

Since no behavior is specified when `desc` is zero, for either `iswctype()` or
`towctrans()`, the behavior is undefined. We do not believe it would be
appropriate to add new requirements here.

### Committee Discussion

The Committee believes this should be considered for a future revision of the
Standard.
