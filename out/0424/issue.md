### Summary

Section 7.26.6 “Thread-specific storage functions” of C11 is severely
underspecified since it uses terms that are not introduced (so far) in the
context of C. This is really a pity, since POSIX also has `pthread_key_t` that
is completely feature equivalent and for which the specification is much more
complete.

Jacob Navia had observed that at several occasions in `comp.std.c` but it seems
that he had not got enough attention such that this had made it in a defect
report.

> The `tss_create` function creates a thread-specific storage pointer with
> destructor `dtor`, which may be null.

The main problem is that it is nowhere explained/defined

* what a destructor should be,
* when such a destructor should be called,
* in which thread context this constructor is executed
* what happens when new destructors are added while others are executed
* what the meaning of the value of `TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS` would be.

### Suggested Technical Corrigendum

I think several paragraphs should be added after the one above:

> The effect is that for each thread that has the thread specific storage
> corresponding to `key` set to a value `x` that is not null, the destructor
> function `*dtor` is called with `dtor(x)` before the thread exits.
>
> This call to `dtor` is executed in the context of the same thread; it is
> sequenced after the `return` statement or the call to `thrd_exit` that
> terminates the thread and before any return from `thrd_join` of a waiter for
> this same thread. If there are several thread specific storages for the same
> thread their destructor functions are called in an unspecific order but with a
> sequence point between each of these function calls.
>
> If a destructor function for `key` issues calls to `tss_set`, `tss_get` or
> `tss_delete` with the same `key` the behavior is undefined.  
> `tss_set` can be used to set the value of a thread specific storage for a
> different key `key2` that had not been set before or that has been processed
> with a call to the corresponding destructor.

By that the set of thread specific storages for a given thread may change during
the execution of the corresponding destructors.

> If after processing all tss that are active at the `return` of the thread
> function or at the end of `thrd_exit` there are still tss that are active the
> procedure of calling destructors is iterated. An implementation may bind the
> maximum number such of supplementary iterations by `TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS`.

A second problem is that there are two functionalities that are easily mixed up
and which interrelationship should be clarified: the destructor that is called
(let us suppose this) at exit of a thread, and `tss_delete` that deletes a
thread specific storage for all running threads. I think something like the
following should be added in 7.26.6.2 after para 2:

> The deletion of `key` will not change the observable behavior of any of the
> active threads. If `tss_delete` is called for `key` and there is a thread that
> has a non-null value for `key` that has passed a terminating `return` statement
> or call to `thrd_exit` but not yet finished the processing of all its tss
> destructors, the behavior is undefined.
