### Summary

Page 32: In 12.3, the function name is written as “**scoshdNx**”, instead of
“**coshdNx**” as intended. Although correcting the mistake could be seen as a
substantive change, it is clear from the context that this function is in the
family of **cosh** functions. It is extremely unlikely that any implementer
would not have recognized the mistake and provided the function with the
erroneous name.

### Suggested Technical Corrigendum

Page 32: In 12.3, change “**scoshdNx**” to “**coshdNx**”.
