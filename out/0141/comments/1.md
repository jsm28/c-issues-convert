### Response

It was certainly the intent of the Committee that end-of-file should indicate
“no more input from a stream,” at least when returned by functions such as
`fgetc`. In particular, subclause 7.9.7.1 **The `fgetc` function** says, in
part:

If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set
and `fgetc` returns `EOF`. “Setting the end-of-file indicator” implies that
*that stream* is now considered to be “at end-of-file.”

For input from a stream to return other than `EOF` after once returning `EOF`
(with no intervening file-positioning operations or calls to `clearerr`) is
non-conforming behavior, however widespread.
