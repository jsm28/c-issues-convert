### Committee Discussion (for history only)

The Committee discussed making the behavior undefined, which would allow
`perror()` to fail if the stream orientation has already been set to wide.

The proposed TC will permit (but not require) `perror` to set the orientation of
an un-oriented `stderr` to narrow, and has what C calls *undefined* behavior if
`stderr` was previously set to wide. This permits the POSIX required behavior.

### Technical Corrigendum

Rescind ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.2:2004 change #67 which states:

> *Page 263, 7.19.1*  
> In paragraph 5, item 4, insert `perror` after `gets`.
