> \[1\] The functions in this subclause round their results to a type typically
> narrower than the parameter types.

Page 40: After the change to C ending with “7.12.13a.6 Square root rounded to
narrower type ... \[3\] These functions return the square root of x, rounded to
the type of the function.”, insert the following:

> In 7.12.13a #1, attach a footnote to the wording:
>
> > typically narrower
>
> where the footnote is:
>
> > \*) In some cases the destination type might not be narrower than the parameter
> > types. For example, **double** might not be narrower than **long double**.
