### Committee Discussion

The Committee is inclined to accept the suggested TC, but the issue is still
being debated.

### Technical Corrigendum

Append to 6.7.2.1#6:

> The keywords `struct` and `union` indicate that the type being specified is,
> respectively, a structure type or a union type.

Add a new paragraph following 6.7.2.3#1:

> \[#1a\] Where two declarations that use the same tag declare the same type, they
> shall both use the same choice of `struct`, `union`, or `enum`.
