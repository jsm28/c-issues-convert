### Response

a) `f` can never return zero. There are three `return` statements:

i) Will always return a value greater than 100\.

ii) `x` and `y` exist at different addresses. An optimizer may invoke the as-if
rule to rearrange code provided it always achieves the required effect.
(Subclause 6.1.2.2: “Identifiers with *no linkage* denote unique entities.”)

iii) Modulo arithmetic may wrap to produce zero. However, it is not possible to
square any number, add 17 and get zero as the result.

b) No, `g` cannot return zero.

c) Yes, `h` can return zero.

d) `j` can never return zero. Subclause 6.7.2 says, “If the declaration of an
identifier for an object has file scope and an initializer, the declaration is
an external definition for the identifier.” Subclause 6.5 says, “A declaration
that also causes storage to be reserved for an object or function named by an
identifier is a *definition.*” Taken together these two statements can be taken
to imply that two file-scope definitions must refer to different objects.
