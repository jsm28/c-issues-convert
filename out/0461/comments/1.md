Apr 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee agrees that clarifying "refers" would be beneficial.
* Allowing access to `const` qualified objects would be a feature and cannot be accomplished by the mechanism of a defect report. Such a feature can be proposed in a separate paper.
* Access to objects of allocated storage duration should also be addressed.
* It is suggested that automatic storage duration objects should also be addressed.
* Further revisions have been solicited from the author.

### Committee Discussion

> The paper [N1874](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1874.htm)
> was submitted and discussed, again, as a defect, rather than as a new proposal,
> and the suggested changes to allow new behavior were again rejected. It was
> noted that a `const volatile` object implemented in hardware, such as random
> number generator, might not provide a consistent value if accessed from a signal
> handler, and so there was general agreement that any changes in this area
> warrant very careful consideration.

### Proposed Committee Response

> Extending the behavior as requested is a feature and appropriate as input to the
> next revision of this Standard. It was noted that a `const volatile` object that
> might seem acceptable to reference from a signal handler might not be if it were
> implemented in hardware (e.g. a hardware random number generator).
