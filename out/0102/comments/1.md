### Response

A diagnostic is required for the `struct`, `union`, and `enum` redeclarations
indicated in the question. Subclause 6.5 indicates that there must be a
diagnostic “except for tags as specified in 6.5.2.3.” In subclause 6.5.2.3, the
specified exception is for subsequent declarations that omit the bracketed list.
