### Response

Does the description in subclause 7.3.1 imply that the characters defined in
subclause 5.2.1 are always classified as implied by subclause 5.2.1 regardless
of the locale specified?

Answer: By subclause 7.3.1.6 **The `islower` function** and subclause 7.3.1.10
**The `isupper` function** which refer to lower- and upper-case letters,
respectively, and by subclause 5.2.1: “basic source and basic execution
character sets shall have at least ... upper-case letters of the English
alphabet” (with example) ... “lower-case letters of the English alphabet” (with
example), and by subclause 5.2.1.2 “The single-byte characters defined in
subclause 5.2.1 shall be present,” which refers to multibyte characters,
therefore, yes, the characters defined in subclause 5.2.1 are always classified
as implied by subclause 5.2.1 regardless of the locale specified.

Do the characters `'a'` through `'z'`, and `'A'` through `'Z'`, have to be
classified as “lower case” and “upper case,” respectively, in every locale?

Answer: Yes, the characters `'a'` through `'z'`, and `'A'` through `'Z'`, have
to be classified as “lower case” and “upper case,” respectively, in every locale
(following the citations above).
