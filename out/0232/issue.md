### Summary

In Annex I *Common warnings* the text:

> * A value is given to an object of an enumeration type other than by assignment of an enumeration constant that is a member of that type, or an enumeration variable that has the same type, or the value of a function that returns the same enumeration type (6.7.2.2).

the "enumeration type" should be "enumerated type".
