### Committee Response

This was intentional because real float promotion to double is in Standard C
purely for compatibility with K\&R. Since complex is new, that compatibility is
not an issue, and having it behave like real float would introduce undesired
overhead (and be less like Fortran).

The following words were added the Rationale.

> `float _Complex` is a new type with C99. It has no need to preserve promotions
> needed by pre-ANSI-C. It does not break existing code.
