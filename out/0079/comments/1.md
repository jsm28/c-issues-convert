### Response

Since the answer to question (b) is needed for question (a) it is given first.

b) Since, according to the fourth item in subclause 7.1.3, the library function
prototypes are implicitly `extern`, the standard library functions have external
linkage.

a) If the usage of `strlen` is such that standard library functions are referred
to, the pointers must compare equal by the requirements of subclauses 5.1.1.2
and 6.1.2.2.

c) The contents of standard headers are implementation-defined. For instance,
they may contain code written in other languages. It is not the job of this
Committee to mandate implementation. Whatever their contents, including a
standard header must achieve the effects required by the C Standard.
