Apr 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* No one on the committee understood the problem that this paper was trying to discuss.
* In particular, the actual difference in behavior referenced between Sun c99 and GCC is not elaborated upon.
* The committee will solicit further input from the author.

Oct 2013 meeting

* As a result of further correspondence with the author, a proposed resolution was made on the WG14 reflector in message 13024 and refined in 13035\.
* The defect is that the initial values of parameters to function calls are specified in the standard in terms of assignment instead of initialization, such that `const` and aggregates containing `const` would be excluded since they cannot be the subject of assignments!
* A Suggested Technical Corrigendum was composed, and follows. It is not yet a Proposed Technical Corrigendum due to the following unresolved discussion points.
* In 6.5.2.2p2 change:

  If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that includes a
  prototype, the number of arguments shall agree with the number of parameters.
  Each argument shall have a type such that its value may be assigned to an object
  with the unqualified version of the type of its corresponding parameter.

  If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that includes a
  prototype, the number of arguments shall agree with the number of parameters.
  Each argument shall have a type such that its value may be used to initialize an
  object having the type of its corresponding parameter.

  In 6.5.2.2p4 change

  An argument may be an expression of any complete object type. In preparing for
  the call to a function, the arguments are evaluated, and each parameter is
  assigned to the value of the corresponding argument.

  An argument may be an expression of any complete object type. In preparing for
  the call to a function, the arguments are evaluated, and each parameter is
  initialized to the value of the corresponding argument.
* It is not clear yet whether there are issues around conversions with respect to this change since this is actual practice that we are intending to simply reflect and to not introduce new constraints.
* This change might be augmented by a new example along the lines of, say, 6.5.16.1 example 3\.

### Committee Discussion

> The issue of conversion has to do with whether there are differing promotions
> and type conversions that would apply when constructing an argument list that
> would not occur if these expressions were used as initializers in a declaration.

### Committee Discussion

> The committee concluded after a discussion that there were no promotion or type
> conversion issues raised by the proposed wording above, and that the following

### Committee Discussion

> The goal of preserving conversions as if by assignment is fulfilled by the
> definition of initialization found in **6.7.9 Initialization** paragraph 11\.
> Another instance of assignment that should be changed was found in **6.9.1
> Function Definitions** paragraph 11\.

> It was noted that implicit conversion is described only in terms of assignment
> (6.5.16.1). There was broad agreement that committee members and implementors
> are unconfused by the intent of the standard here despite the inconsistencies.
> It was also noted that initialization is distinct from assignment and, in the
> case of non-lock free atomic implications, this requires operational differences
> and as such that it is worth further consideration. As such, the following
> should be regarded as a possible direction.

Oct 2015 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee no longer believes that any of the issues raised in this report warrant changes to the standard.
* The difference in behavior on return value semantics cited in gcc has been resolved by a bug fix to gcc
* Qualifiers on the return type of a function are superfluous since by resolution to [DR 423](issue:0423) the committee affirms that qualifiers are dropped as part of the evaluation of expressions including function calls.
* The committee does agree that the use of “assignment” to describe the initialization of function parameters can be misleading, but that in fact there is not an implementation that has ever been misled. Careful reading of the Standard notes that initialization is described fundamentally “as if by assignment”, and that it would take a comprehensive review and edit of the Standard to possibly achieve a more consistent treatment of the topics. There is a danger of circularity that must be avoided as well.

### Proposed Committee Response

> The committee believes that the primary issue of return value semantics was a
> consequence of a mistake in the implementation of `gcc` which has been
> rectified, and that further the treatment of qualifiers has been clarified in
> the Proposed Technical Corrigendum of [DR 423](issue:0423). The treatment of
> initialization in the Standard is clear enough that no errors have been observed
> in implementations, and as such further clarification is unwarranted at this
> time.
