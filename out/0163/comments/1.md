### Response

Identifiers that designate objects must be declared and be visible before they
can be primary expressions (subclause 6.1.2.1, *An identifier is visible (i.e.,
can be used) ...*). A reasonable person could interpret that if no declaration
of some identifier is visible, the identifier cannot be a primary expression.
This affects undeclared identifiers that are intended to be used as implicitly
declared functions. The Committee's intent is that the C Standard be read in the
following order:

1\. **6.3.1 Primary expressions**

**Syntax**

```c
          primary-expression:
                         identifier
```

2\. **6.3.2.2 Function calls**

**Semantics**

If the expression that precedes the parenthesized argument list in a function
call consists solely of an identifier, and if no declaration is visible for this
identifier, the identifier is implicitly declared exactly as if, in the
innermost block containing the function call, the declaration

```c
extern int identifier();
```

appeared.

3\. 6.3.1 **Primary expressions**

**Semantics**

An identifier is a primary expression, provided it has been declared as
designating ... a function (...).

However, a reasonable person may not interpret the current wording as having
that meaning (i.e., it might not be read in that order). This needs to be
clarified in the next revision of the C Standard.

### Response

Identifiers must be declared and visible before they can be primary expressions
(Subclause 6.1.2.1, "An identifier is visible (i.e., can be used) ..."). If no
declaration of some identifier is visible, the identifier cannot be a primary
expression, and a diagnostic is required for a violation of the syntax rule.

Note that a declaration of an identifier might be visible due to the identifier
being implicitly declared (Subclause 6.3.2.2). This should be clarified in the
Standard.

### Future Change

In Subclause 6.3.1, first paragraph in "Semantics"

Change

> "An identifier is a primary expression, provided is has been declared as
> designating an object (in which case it is an lvalue) or a function (in which
> case it is a function designator)."

To

> "An identifier is a primary expression, provided is has been declared as
> designating an object (in which case it is an lvalue) or implicitly**\*** or
> explicitly declared as designating a function (in which case it is a function
> designator)."
> 
> The **\*** above references the new footnote:

"See 6.3.2.2."
