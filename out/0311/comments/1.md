### Committee Discussion (for history only)

Declarators don't contain a type, it is the sequence of declarators that
contains types.

The sentence in 6.7.5;p3 that defines variably modified types may be wrong, and
that may not even be the right place for it to be defined. The definition ties
it too closely to the declarator. In the example provided in the DR, the type of
`y` is variably modified. The declarator for `y` does not include a variable
length array type. Para 3 needs to have it's wording adjusted in some fashion,
the text there is insufficient to provide us the answer.

The definition in the standard for variable length array does not seem to be in
italics.

2006-Mar-29:

For the reason noted in the Summary, variably modified types do need to be tied
to the declarator syntax.  But the current definition fails to state that a new
type derived from a variably modified type is itself variably modified.

### Committee Response

Yes, this is a defect in the definition..  The definition will be modified to
state explicitly that types derived from a variably modified type are themselves
variably modified.

### Technical Corrigendum

\[**Note**, these are relative to wg14's
[N1124](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf).\]

Change 3rd sentence in 6.7.5p3 from:

> If the nested sequence of declarators in a full declarator contains a variable
> length array type, the type specified by the full declarator is said to be
> *variably modified*.

to

> If in the nested sequence of declarators in a full declarator there is a
> declarator specifying a variable length array type, the type specified by the
> full declarator is said to be *variably modified*.  Furthermore, any type
> derived by declarator type derivation from a variably modified type is itself
> variably modified.
