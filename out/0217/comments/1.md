### Committee Response

From 7.1.4 paragraph 1:

> If an argument to a function has an invalid value (such as a value outside the
> domain of the function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program,
> or a null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the corresponding
> parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after promotion) not expected by a
> function with variable number of arguments, the behavior is undefined.

Thus, `asctime()` may exhibit undefined behavior if any of the members of
`timeptr` produce undefined behavior in the sample algorithm (for example, if
the `timeptr->tm_wday` is outside the range 0 to 6 the function may index beyond
the end of an array).

As always, the range of undefined behavior permitted includes:

* Corrupting memory
* Aborting the program
* Range checking the argument and returning a failure indicator (e.g., a null pointer)
* Returning truncated results within the traditional 26 byte buffer.

There is no consensus to make the suggested change or any change along this
line.
