Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee agrees that the floating point environment is not an object and must be stated in normative terms instead of in non-normative footnote 205\.
* The environment may be modified more than once in an expression without inducing undefined behavior, this is just "how it works".
* The floating-point environment is described in the standard using an otherwise undefined term "system variable" having 7.6p2 thread storage duration, implying that it is an object, and so this is perhaps the actual manifestation of the defect that requires correction.
* The floating-point environment is technically an actor, not an object, having a model of its behavior defined purely by messages as its internal "piece of state" is not directly visible. In this case the messages are the macros and functions, as are the electronic signals from the floating-point computational units to consult and honor the desired floating point modal behaviors, and the electronic signals that record "auxiliary information" in the model for floating point exceptions.
* In any case, the floating point environment implementation is not described by the abstract C machine, only its operations.
* The committee prefers that this be cleared up in 7.6, by moving the second sentence and possibly the first sentence into normative text.

### Committee Discussion

> The committee discusses this issue further and could not see an actual defect:
> there are no misinterpretations stated or implied.

### Proposed Committee Response

> Since operations on the floating point environment are well defined there is no
> need to normatively define anything further about its implementation. The
> footnote adds clarity and should remain as is.
