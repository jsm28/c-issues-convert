### Technical Corrigendum

>    wchar_t
> ```
>
> which is an integer type whose range of values can represent distinct codes for
> all members of the largest extended character set specified among the supported
> locales; the null character shall have the code value zero. Each member of the
> basic character set shall have a code value equal to its value when used as the
> lone character in an integer character constant if an implementation does not
> define `__STDC_MB_MIGHT_NEQ_WC__`.
