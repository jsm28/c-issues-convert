### Response

The behavior is undefined in both cases; case (2) is clear from subclause 7.9.3
**Files**, page 126, lines 24-27, “A file may be disassociated from a
controlling stream by *closing* the file... The value of a pointer to a `FILE`
object is indeterminate after the associated file is closed (including the
standard text streams).” Also subclause 7.9.3 **Files**, page 126, lines 2-3 and
lines 37-39, “A stream is associated with an external file... by *opening* a
file, ... At program startup, three text streams are predefined and need not be
opened explicitly...” Also subclause 7.9.5.3 **The `fopen` function**, and,
similarly, subclause 7.9.5.4 **The `freopen` function**: “The ... function opens
the file ... and associates a stream with it...” Thus when subclause 7.9.5.4
says “The `freopen` function ... associates the stream pointed to by `stream`
with it,” the intention is certainly that `stream` already points to a valid
stream. Extending this to case (1), we observe that `a` (or `&a`) might not
refer to a stream, since none has been “associated” by any means specified in
the C Standard.
