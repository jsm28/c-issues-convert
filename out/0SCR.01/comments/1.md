### Committee Discussion

> The words in 5.21 were revised but the example wasn't. A revised example was
> approved as a Proposed Technical Corregendum. A new paper was solicited to
> capture the issue raised by the changed example.

Oct 1014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> A new paper [N1860](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1860.htm)
> proposing a new rule was submitted and discussed, and it was determined that
> since the original example illustrated an issue, that we could consider this a
> defect after all.
>
> The following Proposed Technical Corrigendum corrects the existing example to
> match the 5.21 rule, and adds a new clause and example to capture the intent of
> the original 5.21 example.
>
> The existing example has an explanation, and the words approved do not, and the
> following have been suggested.
>
> > EXAMPLE 1 In this noncompliant example, a diagnostic is required because `n` is
> > `sizeof(p)`, which is smaller than `sizeof(struct S1)`, so N is 0
> >
> > EXAMPLE 2 In this noncompliant example, a diagnostic is required because `n` is
> > 14 and `sizeof(wchar_t)` is 2, making N equal 7\. `q` is therefore treated as an
> > array of 7 elements, but `wcscpy` attempts to copy `p`, an array with 14
> > elements, into it.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In rule 5.21, Rule section, replace

> A call to a standard memory allocation function taking a size integer argument
> `n` and presumed to be intended for type `T *` shall be diagnosed when `n <
> sizeof(T)`.

with

> A call to a standard memory allocation function taking a size integer argument
> `n` and presumed to be intended for type `T *` shall be regarded as an array of
> `N` elements, where `N = n / sizeof(T)`.
>
> Any allocation where `N == 0` shall be diagnosed (i.e. where `n < sizeof(T)`).
> Also, any attempt to use this array in a manner that causes its array bound to
> be violated shall be diagnosed.

In rule 5.21, replace

> EXAMPLE In this noncompliant example, a diagnostic is required because the value
> of `n` that is used in the `malloc()` call has been possibly miscalculated.
>
> ```c
> wchar_t *f1(void) {
>   const wchar_t *p = L"Hello, World!";
>   const size_t n = sizeof(p) * (wcslen(p) + 1);
>   wchar_t *q = (wchar_t *)malloc(n);  // diagnostic required
>
>   /* ... */
>   return q;
> }
> ```

with

> EXAMPLE 1

>     struct S1 {

>     };
>
>
>     struct S1 *f1(void) {
>         struct S1 *p = (struct S1*)malloc(sizeof(p));  // diagnostic required
>         return p;

> EXAMPLE 2
>
>     wchar_t *f2(void) {
>         const wchar_t *p = L"Hello, World!";
>         const size_t n = (wcslen(p) + 1);
>         wchar_t *q = (wchar_t *)malloc(n);
>         wcscpy(q, p); // diagnostic required
