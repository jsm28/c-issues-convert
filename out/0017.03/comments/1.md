### Correction

***In subclause 5.1.1.3, page 6, lines 15-17, change:***

A conforming implementation shall produce at least one diagnostic message
(identified in an implementation-defined manner) for every translation unit that
contains a violation of any syntax rule or constraint.

***to:***

A conforming implementation shall produce at least one diagnostic message
(identified in an implementation-defined manner) for every translation unit that
contains a violation of any syntax rule or constraint, even if the behavior is
also explicitly specified as undefined or implementation-defined.

***Add to subclause 5.1.1.3, page 6:***

**Example**

An implementation shall issue a diagnostic for the translation unit:

```c
char i;
 int i;
```

because in those cases where wording in this International Standard describes
the behavior for a construct as being both a constraint error and resulting in
undefined behavior, the constraint error shall be diagnosed.
