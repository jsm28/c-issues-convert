Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> * The desired and intended syntax is indeed missing.
> * Whereas one could achieve the desired effect by placing the directive on the aggregate itself and controlling it by the maximum alignment of each of its members, this is far from the intended goal, and we do consider this a defect.
> * We solicit a suggested technical corrigendum from the author.
> * Modifying the definition of type name will require considerable thought.
> * Applying the directive beyond aggregate members, such as a simple scalar declaration, is not well defined, and brings in the various storage durations and how or whether all or any are supported.

Apr 2014 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The author provided the following technical corrigendum as input to [N1804](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1804.htm):   
   6.7.2.1#1: Move the definition of specifier-qualifier-list to 6.7.7#1. Insert a new definition in 6.7.2.1#1:
  > specifier-qualifier-alignment-list:
  >
  > type-specifier specifier-qualifier-alignment-list\_opt  
  > type-qualifier specifier-qualifier-alignment-list\_opt  
  > alignment-specifier specifier-qualifier-alignment-list\_opt

  Change the use of specifier-qualifier-list in the syntax for struct-declaration
  to specifier-qualifier-alignment-list.

  6.7.2#2:

  > Change "and in the specifier-qualifier list in each struct declaration and type
  > name" to ", in the specifier-qualifier-alignment list in each struct declaration
  > and in the specifier-qualifier list in each type name".

  6.7.3#5:

  > Change "specifier-qualifier-list" to "specifier-qualifier-list,
  > specifier-qualifier-alignment-list or declaration-specifiers" (twice).

  (That the wording about duplicate qualifiers and qualifiers used with \_Atomic doesn't deal with declaration-specifiers, the syntax production relevant to normal declarations, is a pre-existing problem noticed in the course of preparing this wording.)

  (I believe all the semantics and constraints required for alignment specifiers
  on members are in place, including 6.2.7#1 dealing with cross-translation-unit
  type compatibility and references to bit-fields and members in 6.7.5.)
* The committee agrees with this as the proper direction and will solicit further review from implementors.

>
> * `_Alignas` needs to be applied wherever objects are laid out in memory. On modern architectures page and cache line alignment of data structures is increasingly critical for performance.
> * Alignment is incorporated into the type system for structure (and union) members, but otherwise is not considered part of the type.
>
> In 6.7.3p5, there are two references to *specifier-qualifier-list*, which should
> also reference declaration specifiers.
>
> In 6.7.5 paragraphs 2 and 4, there are occurrences of the phrase “alignment
> attribute” which should instead read “alignment specifier”

### Committee Discussion

> The committee did not discuss the direction from the last meeting in any

### Committee Discussion

> A new paper [N2028](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2028.htm)
> was submitted that embodied the direction above and the committee accepted it.

Oct 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> It was noted that C\+\+ allows one additional production for

>
> The paper [N2028](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2028.htm)

**Proposed Technical Correigendum**

Change 6.7.2.1p1 from

> *specifier-qualifier-list*:
>
> > *type-specifier specifier-qualifier-list<sub>opt</sub>*
> >
> > *type-qualifier specifier-qualifier-list<sub>opt</sub>*

to

> *specifier-qualifier-list*:

> >
> > *type-qualifier specifier-qualifier-list<sub>opt</sub>*
> >
> > *alignment-specifier specifier-qualifier-list<sub>opt</sub>*

Change 6.7.5p2 from

> An alignment attribute shall not be specified in a declaration of a typedef, or
> a bit-field, or a function, or a parameter, or an object declared with the
> `register` storage-class specifier.

to

> An alignment specifier shall appear only in the declaration specifiers of a
> declaration, or in the specifier-qualifier list of a member declaration, or in
> the type name of a compound literal. An alignment specifier shall not be used in
> conjunction with either of the storage-class specifiers `typedef` or `register`,
> nor in a declaration of a function or bit-field.

Change 6.7.3p5 from

> If the same qualifier appears more than once in the same
> *specifier-qualifier-list*, either directly or via one or more `typedef`s, the
> behavior is the same as if it appeared only once. If other qualifiers appear
> along with the `_Atomic` qualifier in a *specifier-qualifier-list*, the
> resulting type is the so-qualified atomic type.

to

> If the same qualifier appears more than once in the same
> *specifier-qualifier-list* or as *declaration-specifiers*, either directly or
> via one or more `typedef`s, the behavior is the same as if it appeared only
> once. If other qualifiers appear along with the `_Atomic` qualifier the
> resulting type is the so-qualified atomic type.

Change 6.7.5p4 from

> The combined effect of all alignment attributes in a declaration shall not...

to

> The combined effect of all alignment specifiers in a declaration shall not...
