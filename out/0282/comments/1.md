### Technical Corrigendum

In 6.7.2.1 paragraph 16, replace the second and third sentences ("With two ...
106)" with the following text:.

> In most situations, the flexible array member is ignored. In particular, the
> size of the structure is as if the flexible array member were omitted except
> that it may have more trailing padding than the omission would imply.
>
> replace "Second" with "However" at the start of the following sentence, and
> delete footnote 106\.

> Replace the examples (paragraphs 17 to 20\) with:
