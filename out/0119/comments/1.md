### Response

a) No, a diagnostic is not required. It is a semantic requirement that array
elements must be objects, not a constraint.

b) No, this is undefined behavior. Note that `array` does not have an array type
because its element type is not an object type; hence subclause 6.5.7 does not
apply. See subclause 6.1.2.5.
