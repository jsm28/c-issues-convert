The relevant citation is subclause 7.6.2.1:

In response to your question about the effect on optimizations of `setjmp`: Yes,
it is legitimate for a compiler to perform optimizations that eliminate dead
stores to local, non-volatile, automatic variables when `setjmp` is used.
Subclause 7.6.2.1 makes the values of all such variables indeterminate after the
`longjmp` is called. This grants a compiler the liberty to perform dead-store
elimination as well as several other optimizations.
