### Response

The explicit constraint on pre/post increment/decrement operators (subclauses
6.3.2.4 and 6.3.3.1) is not required. Early on, the Committee decided that if a
behavior was described as being equivalent to another construct, all of the
constraints of that construct would apply. This “chaining” process means that
any violation of a constraint in any section referred to explicitly or by the
phrases “equivalent behavior” or “as if” will generate a diagnostic.

Both subclauses 6.3.2.4 and 6.3.3.1 state in their respective **Semantics**
sections, “See the discussions of additive operators and compound assignment for
information on constraints, types, \[side effects,] and conversions and the
effects of operations on pointers.”

The **Semantics** section of subclause 6.3.16.2 states, “A *compound assignment*
of the form `E1` *`op`*`= E2` differs from the simple assignment expression `E1
= E1` *`op`* `(E2)` only in that the lvalue `E1` is evaluated only once.”

This makes the pre/post increment/decrement equivalent to adding or subtracting
1 to/from an object. Looking at subclause 6.3.6 for the constraints on additive
operators, in each case which refers to pointer operands, the C Standard uses
the phrase “pointer to an object type.” Since incomplete types and function
types are not object types, their use as operands of these operators is
precluded.
