### Correction

***Add to subclause 6.5.1, page 58 (Semantics):***

If an aggregate or union object is declared with a storage-class specifier other
than `typedef`, the properties resulting from the storage-class specifier,
except with respect to linkage, also apply to the members of the object, and so
on recursively for any aggregate or union member objects.
