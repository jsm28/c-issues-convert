### Response

May a standard conforming implementation make characters in its character set
that are not in the required source character set identifier characters?

Answer: Yes.

Can these additional identifier characters be used in preprocessor identifier
tokens as well as post-processor identifier tokens?

Answer: Yes, but the C Standard is currently ambiguous about the parsing of a
definition such as:

```c
#define abc$ x
```

This could either define `abc$` as `x` or `abc` as `$x`. The Correction that
follows resolves the ambiguity.

### Correction

***Add to subclause 6.8, page 86 (Constraints):***

In the definition of an object-like macro, if the first character of a
replacement list is not a character required by subclause 5.2.1, then there
shall be white-space separation between the identifier and the replacement
list.**\***

\[Footnote \*: This allows an implementation to choose to interpret the
directive:

```c
#define THIS$AND$THAT(a, b) ((a) + (b))
```

as defining a function-like macro `THIS$AND$THAT`, rather than an object-like
macro `THIS`. Whichever choice it makes, it must also issue a diagnostic.]
