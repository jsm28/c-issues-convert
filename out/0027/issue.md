May a standard conforming implementation make characters in its character set
that are not in the required source character set identifier characters? Can
these additional identifier characters be used in preprocessor identifier tokens
as well as post-processor identifier tokens?

Subclause G.5.2 states:

> Characters other than the underscore `_`, letters, and digits, that are not
> defined in the required source character set (such as the dollar sign `$`, or
> characters in national character sets) may appear in an identifier (subclause
> 6.1.2).
