### Summary

The undefined behavior defined in paragraph 6 of 6.5.5 is missing in J.2 and
should be added.

### Suggested Technical Corrigendum

Add a bullet with the following text to J.2 after bullet 45

> If the quotient `a/b` is not representable, the behavior of both `a/b` and `a%b`
> is undefined (6.5.5).
