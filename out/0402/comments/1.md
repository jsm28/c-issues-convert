### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

> In 5.1.2.4 Paragraph 22 starting at the third sentence, add:
>
> > If an operation `A` that modifies an atomic object `M` happens before an
> > operation `B` that modifies `M` , then `A` shall be earlier than `B` in the
> > modification order of `M` .
> >
> > *NOTE:* The requirement above is known as write-write coherence.
> >
> > If a value computation `A` of an atomic object `M` happens before a value
> > computation `B` of `M` , and `A` takes its value from a side effect `X` on `M`,
> > then the value computed by `B` shall either be the value stored by `X` or the
> > value stored by a side effect `Y` on `M`, where `Y` follows `X` in the
> > modification order of `M`.
> >
> > *NOTE:* The requirement above is known as read-read coherence.
> >
> > If a value computation `A` of an atomic object `M` happens before an operation
