### Committee Discussion

The committee agrees that this is a defect and accepts the Suggested Technical
Corrigendum

Apr 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

A new paper [N2127](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2127.pdf)
was presented which offers a simplified Technical Corrigendum. From that paper:

> The TC in DR 501 includes two changes to TS 18661-3, one for the usual
> arithmetic conversions, the other for type-generic math. The first change fills
> in missing conversions for new types in TS 18661-3. The second change simplifies
> type-generic math by referencing the usual arithmetic conversions, and thereby
> also fills in missing type-generic math rules for arguments of the new types.
>
> This is a proposal for an alternative change to type-generic math. The original
> change was proposed for TS 18661-3, where the new types where introduced.
> However, the change can be made in TS 18661-2, where it is easier to understand
> and leads to a simplification in TS 18661-3.

The committee accepts the proposed modification as reflected below.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In TS 18662-3

In clause 8, change the replacement text for 6.3.1.8#1:

> If one operand has decimal floating type, the other operand shall not have
> standard floating type, binary floating type, complex type, or imaginary type.
>
> If both operands have floating types and neither of the sets of values of their
> corresponding real types is a subset of (or equivalent to) the other, the
> behavior is undefined.
>
> Otherwise, if both operands are floating types and the sets of values of their
> corresponding real types are equivalent, then the following rules are applied:
>
> > If both operands have the same corresponding real type, no further conversion is
> > needed.
> >
> > Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is an interchange
> > floating type, the other operand is converted, without change of type domain, to
> > a type whose corresponding real type is that same interchange floating type.
> >
> > Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is a standard
> > floating type, the other operand is converted, without change of type domain, to
> > a type whose corresponding real type is that same standard floating type.
>
> Otherwise, if both operands have floating types, the operand, whose set of
> values of its corresponding real type is a (proper) subset of the set of values
> of the corresponding real type of the other operand, is converted, without
> change of type domain, to a type with the corresponding real type of that other
> operand.
>
> Otherwise, if one operand has a floating type, the other operand is converted to
> the corresponding real type of the operand of floating type.
>
> Otherwise, the integer promotions are performed on both operands. Then the
> following rules are applied to the promoted operands:

> > . . .

In TS 18661-2

In 12.9, change the introduced \[3c] from:
