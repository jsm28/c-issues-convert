Oct 2016 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee notes that since all known implementations but one "get it right"
> this may well not be a defect at all.

Apr 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> The committee discussed this issue at some length. By the strict reading of the
> standard, one concludes that only structures are supported, not unions, and that
> only named members of structures rather than extended references to sub-objects
> in a recursive fashion are allowed.
> 
> Implementations commonly treat the standard as if it had been defined in terms
> of named members and sub-objects recursively, and would likely be sympathetic to
> a paper that consolidates existing practice since this seems to be a nearly
> universal extension.
> 
> There was no discussion asserting that this extension, however, was the actual
> intent of the standard, and as such there is was no sentiment to accept these
> extensions with clarified wording. Such a change could only be made in a new
> revision of the standard.

Oct 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

A small paper was discussed and its contents reflected below in the PTC.
Although the committee believes that allowing this for unions was originally
intended, there was no opinion expressed that allowing new type declarations was
intended. So the answers to questions in the first two bullet points are yes,
and to the third, no, and the fourth is moot.

Apr 2018 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> There was committee consensus that such a construct should be a new constraint
> violation. A new paper was solicited.

### Proposed Committee Response

> expression.

### Proposed Change

Change the following words in ยง7.19 p 3 from:
