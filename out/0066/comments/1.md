### Response

Of the four `strlen` calls, the first must return 1, the second must return 0 or
1, and the other two must return 0 or more, in a conforming implementation.
There is a specific requirement for `decimal_point` in the second paragraph of
subclause 7.4.2.1 **Description**, and in the individual descriptions
“character” is intended to imply 0 or 1 while “string” is meant to imply 0 or
more.
