### Suggested Future Change

In subclause 7.1.3, Reserved Identifiers, change bullet 2 to:

> All identifiers that begin with an underscore are always reserved for use as
> macros and as identifiers with file scope in both the ordinary and tag name
> spaces.

Change bullet 5 to:

> Each identifier with file scope listed in any of the following subclauses
> (including the Future library directions) is reserved for use as a macro and as
> an identifier with file scope in the same name space if any of its associated
> headers is included.
