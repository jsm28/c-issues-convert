### Technical Corrigendum

Change 7.19.6.1 paragraph 8 and 7.24.2.1 paragraph 8 to:

> `g,G`
>
> > A `double` argument representing a floating-point number is converted in style
> > `f` or `e` (or in style `F` or `E` in the case of a `G` conversion specifier),
> > depending on the value converted and the precision. Let `P` equal the precision
> > if non-zero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero. Then,
> > if a conversion with style `E` would have an exponent of `X`:
> >
> > * if `P > X >= -4`, the conversion is with style `f` (or `F`) and precision `P - (X + 1)`.
> > * otherwise the conversion is with style `e` (or `E`) and precision `P - 1`.
>
> Finally, unless the `#` flag is used, any trailing zeroes are removed from the
> fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point character is removed if
> there is no fractional portion remaining.
