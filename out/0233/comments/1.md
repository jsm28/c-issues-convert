### Committee Discussion (for history only)

There seemed to be some uncertainty about whether (for the `%.4g` example) the
exponent would be `0` or `1`. This could yield different results.

Some Committee members wondered whether the exponent would be `1` or `0` for
ZERO. The bullet describing `e, E` is clear on this though "If the value is
zero, the exponent is zero".

If there is no implementation representation of ZERO, but rather a very small
number. In this case, we generally thought that this was a user problem, that
they could not rely on a true ZERO having a representation, in which case, they
would need to place their own checks for what approximations were acceptable as
ZERO and print a literal instead.

Some pathological cases were checked, and appeared to work correctly.

NOTE: In discussion, the original bullets were:

* if X \< -4 or X \>\= P, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P \- 1
* otherwise the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision P \- ( X \+ 1 )

But these were changed to:

* if P \> X \>\= -4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision P \- ( X \+ 1 )
* otherwise the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P \- 1

During discussion, as it was considered to be the more pure form.
