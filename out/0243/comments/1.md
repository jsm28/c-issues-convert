### Technical Corrigendum

In 7.12.10.2 `remainder`:

Add to Returns:

> If `y` is zero, whether a domain error occurs or the `remainder` functions
> return zero is implementation defined.

In 7.12.10.3 `remquo`:

Add to Returns:

> If `y` is zero, whether a domain error occurs or the `remquo` functions return
> zero is implementation defined.
> 
> If `y` is zero, the quotient stored is unspecified.

In J.3.12 Library functions:

Add (after fmod):

> Whether a domain error occurs or zero is returned when an `remainder` function
> has a second argument of zero (7.12.10.2).
> 
> Whether a domain error occurs or zero is returned when an `remquo` function has
> a second argument of zero (7.12.10.3).
