### Response

Subclause 6.5.2.1 states “A bit-field is interpreted as an integral type
consisting of the specified number of bits.” Thus the type of `object1.bit` and
`object2.bit` can be informally described as `unsigned int : 1`. A larger
integer is converted to this type according to the rules in subclause 6.2.1.2.
Thus the value 3 is converted to the value 1\.

The program is strictly conforming. It prints `1 1`.
