Apr 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* The committee agrees that the standard is missing an explicit requirement for floating point zero.
* There is no need for the clause **if x !\= 0**.

### Proposed Change

The first sentance in 5.2.4.2.2 #3 should be changed to:

> Floating types shall be able to represent normalized floating-point numbers
> (f<sub>1</sub> \> 0\) and (positive or unsigned) zero. In addition, floating
> types may be able to contain other kinds of floating-point numbers, such as
> negative zero and subnormal ...

### Committee Discussion

This is a necessary but not sufficient change to address the problem, and as
such, it was considered more dangerous to have than to have not, and was
reopened. Combining this PTC with that of [**<u>DR 467</u>**](issue:0467) should
resolve the issue completely.

### Committee Response

> The "C17" edition of the standard has been published as IS 9899:2018.
> 
> This issue was not resolved in that publication.
> 
> The committee is now considering changes for the next revision of the standard,
> and asks that this proposed change and that from [CR 467](issue:0467) be
> combined in a new paper to completely resolve this issue.
