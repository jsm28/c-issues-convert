### Correction

***Add to subclause 7.11.1, page 162:***

Where an argument declared as `size_t n` specifies the length of the array for a
function, `n` can have the value zero on a call to that function. Unless
explicitly stated otherwise in the description of a particular function in this
subclause, pointer arguments on such a call must still have valid values, as
described in subclause 7.1.7. On such a call, a function that locates a
character finds no occurrence, a function that compares two character sequences
returns zero, and a function that copies characters copies zero characters.
