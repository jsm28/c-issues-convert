### Technical Corrigendum

Change the last sentence of paragraph 5 of 7.6 Floating-point environment
`<fenv.h>` to be:

> The defined macros expand to integer constant expressions with values such that
> bitwise ORs of all combinations of the macros result in distinct values, and
> furthermore, bitwise ANDs of all combinations of the macros result in zero.

In addition, add a footnote to that sentance along the lines of:

> The macros should be distinct powers of two.
