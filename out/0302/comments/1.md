### Technical Corrigendum

Change 6.10.2p5:

> The implementation shall provide unique mappings for sequences consisting of one
> or more ~~letters or digits (as defined in 5.2.1)~~ <u>*nondigits* or *digits*
> (6.4.2.1)</u> followed by a period (.) and a single ~~letter~~
> <u>*nondigit*</u>. The first character shall ~~be a letter~~ <u>not be a
> *digit*</u>. The implementation may ignore the distinctions of alphabetical case
> and restrict the mapping to eight significant characters before the period.
