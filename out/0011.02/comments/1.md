### Correction

***In subclause 6.1.2.2, page 21, change:***

If the declaration of an identifier for an object or a function contains the
storage-class specifier `extern`, the identifier has the same linkage as any
visible declaration of the identifier with file scope. If there is no visible
declaration with file scope, the identifier has external linkage.

***to:***

For an identifier declared with the storage-class specifier `extern` in a scope
in which a prior declaration of that identifier is visible**\***, if the prior
declaration specifies internal or external linkage, the linkage of the
identifier at the latter declaration becomes the linkage specified at the prior
declaration. If no prior declaration is visible, or if the prior declaration
specifies no linkage, then the identifier has external linkage. \[Footnote \*:
As specified in 6.1.2.1, the latter declaration might hide the prior
declaration.]
