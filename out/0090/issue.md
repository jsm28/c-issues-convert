Item 27 \- multibyte characters in formats

Consider a locale where the characters `'\xE'` and `'\xF'` start and end an
alternate shift state (i.e., the latter reverts to the initial shift state), and
where multibyte characters whose first byte is greater than or equal to 0x80 are
two bytes long. The multibyte characters and the alternate shift state
characters are all distinct from the basic execution character set (subclause
5.2.1). What is the output generated by the following `fprintf` calls?

> ```c
>         fprintf (stdout, "Test A: (%d)\n", 42);
>         fprintf (stdout, "Test B: (\xE%d\xF)\n", 42);
>         fprintf (stdout, "Test C: (\xE%\xF" "d)\n", 42);
>         fprintf (stdout, "Test D: (\xCC%d)\n", 42);
>         fprintf (stdout, "Test E: (\xE\xCC%d\xF)\n", 42);
>         fprintf (stdout, "Test F: (\xE\xCC%\xF" "d)\n", 42);
> ```
