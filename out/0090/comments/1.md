### Response

The first call contains no locale-specific characters and must produce the
obvious output. The remainder of this response addresses the subsequent calls.

The hypothetical locale is defined such that “the multibyte characters and the
alternate shift state characters are all distinct from the basic execution
character set.” Thus the `%` character in the string literal is not the same
character as the `%` that introduces a conversion specification (subclauses
7.9.6.1 and 7.9.6.2) because it is distinct.

The C Standard says, “The format is composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary multibyte characters (not `%`), which are copied unchanged to the
output stream, ...” Therefore, the output generated by the example `fprintf`
calls is the format argument copied unchanged to the output stream. Note that
the third argument in each call to `fprintf` is not needed.
