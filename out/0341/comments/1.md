### Committee Discussion

#### Spring 2007

There was consensus that the first example should be valid, and the second
should be invalid.

Also see [N1238](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1238.htm).

**Fall 2007**

Above reference to N1238 is not relevant.

It appears the issue hinges entirely on the point that a *type-name* is not a
declaration and does not declare an identifier, and because of that it has no
scope. Instead of adding complex wording to avoid using the term "scope" as
suggested in the DR, it seems clearer to modify the definition of Scope such
that it applies to *type-name*, which is described in 6.7.6 as "syntactically a
declaration for a function or an object of that type that omits the identifier".

**Spring 2008**

The Committee does not see a way to avoid this change, it seems to be safe. Not
altogether satisfied with the aesthetics of this change, but this seems to be a
satisfactory way forward.

### Technical Corrigendum

6.2.1, add a new paragraph at the end (following paragraph 7):

> As a special case, a *type-name* (which is not a declaration of an identifier)
> is considered to have a scope that begins just after the place within the
> *type-name* where the omitted identifier would appear were it not omitted.

Also add a forward reference to Type names (6.7.6).

6.7.5.2 paragraph 4, change

> declarations with function prototype scope

to

> declarations or type-names with function prototype scope
