### Committee Discussion (for history only)

The Committee thinks that the programming community would be better served by
flagging the `gets()` function as deprecated.

### Technical Corrigendum

Add to subclause 7.26.9:

> The `gets` function is obsolescent, and is deprecated.

Add forward reference in 7.19.7.7 to 7.26.9
