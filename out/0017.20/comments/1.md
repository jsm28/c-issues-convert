### Response

Subclause 6.1.2 on page 20, line 5, states “Macro names and macro parameters are
not considered further here.” This approach was intentionally adopted to avoid
explicitly having to mention exceptions of using identifiers, for example in the
sections on scope, linkage, name spaces, and storage durations, none of which
applies to macros. The proposed change does *not* clarify the standard and may
even obscure it.
