### Response

a) Every enumerated type is compatible with some integer type (subclause
6.5.2.2). When conversion takes place between compatible types, values are not
altered (subclause 6.2). So for values between 0 and `SCHAR_MAX`, the original
value must result, because no matter what type is chosen, the value can be
expressed in that type.

b) Yes it can.

c-g) It is the intention of the C Standard that all the members of the
enumeration be representable in the enumerated type, and that the compatible
integer type be one which promotes to `int` or `unsigned int`.

h) An implementation is not allowed to add other types to the list. (See reply
to [Defect Report #067](issue:0067).)

### Correction

***In subclause 6.5.2.2, page 61, second paragraph of Semantics, change:***

Each enumerated type shall be compatible with an integer type; the choice of
type is implementation-defined.

***to:***

Each enumerated type shall be compatible with an integer type. The choice of
type is implementation-defined, but shall be capable of representing the values
of all the members of the enumeration.
