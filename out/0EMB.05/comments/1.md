Problem: The replacement text for 6.2.6.3 para 3, last sentence says 'integer
types' while it should say 'fixed-point types' (twice).

Solution: Make the change

Change: Replace the last sentence of the replacement text for 6.2.6.3 para 3
with: The width of a fixed-point type is the same but including any sign bit;
thus for unsigned fixed-point types the two values are the same, while for
signed fixed-point types the width is one greater than the precision.
