These sections, both separately and together, define the relationship between
the result type of `sizeof` and the type `size_t` defined in `stddef.h`. The
result type of `sizeof` and the type `size_t` defined in `stddef.h` are an
unsigned integral type, and `size_t` defined in `<stddef.h>` is identical to the
result type of `sizeof`. To restate, in a conforming implementation, the result
type of `sizeof` will be the same as the type of `size_t` defined in
`<stddef.h>`.

Since these two types are the same, there need be no mechanism for a compiler to
discover the type of `size_t` defined in `<stddef.h>`. A compiler's private
knowledge of the result type of `sizeof` is as good as `stddef.h`'s private
knowledge of the type of `size_t`.

Note that the result of `sizeof` has the same type as not just any `size_t,` but
the `size_t` defined in `<stddef.h>`.
