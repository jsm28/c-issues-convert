### Committee Discussion

> The committee accepts the correction of "normalized" but concludes that adding
> the suggested macros is a feature and out of scope for a DR.

### Committee Discussion

> email reflector starting with [(SC22WG14.13764)
> LDBL\_MAX](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/13764) suggesting that since

> formed, and the following words are provided as food for further committee

### Committee Discussion

> The committee agrees with the reflector discussion.

Apr 2017 meeting

### Committee Discussion

> Additional input to the Proposed Technical Corrigendum was suggested and adopted
> by the committee from [DR 467
> PTC](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/14655).
> 
> Further, after discussion, the change from [DR 432](issue:0432) is now viewed as
> necessary but not sufficient, and so it will be further reviewed before being
> incorporated into a future version of the standard along with these changes.

### Proposed Change

In §5.2.4.2.2#1 after the definition of the floating point model parameters,
add:

> For each floating-point type: *b*, *e<sub>min</sub>*, *e<sub>max</sub>*, *p* are
> fixed constants.

In §5.2.4.2.2#3 change:

> In addition to normalized floating-point numbers ( *f<sub>1</sub>* \> 0 if *x* ≠
> 0),

to:

> In addition to *normalized floating-point numbers* ( *f<sub>1</sub>* \> 0 if *x*
> ≠ 0), all possible *f<sub>k</sub>* digits result in values representable in the
> type<sup>footnote</sup>.
> 
> <sup>footnote</sup>: Some implementations may have types with numeric values
> which are not covered by this model.

In 5.2.4.2.2#12, first item change the phrase

> maximum representable finite floating-point number, \[ math formula ]

to

> maximum representable finite floating-point number; if that value is normalized,
> its value is \[ math formula ],

In 5.2.4.2.2#13, first item change the phrase

> the difference between 1 and the least value greater than 1

to

> the difference between 1 and the least normalized value greater than 1

Oct 2018 meeting

### Committee Response

> The "C17" edition of the standard has been published as IS 9899:2018.
> 
> This issue was not resolved in that publication.
> 
> The committee is now considering changes for the next revision of the standard,
> and asks that this proposed change and that from [CR 432](issue:0432) be
> combined in a new paper to completely resolve this issue.
