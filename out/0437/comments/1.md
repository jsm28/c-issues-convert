Oct 2013 meeting

### Committee Discussion

* This issue is tied to Austin Group Defect #686.
* The committee feels that the core issue regards required behavior under the condition that overflow occurs in the implementations choice for the representation of `clock_t`.
* It is noted that many and possibly most implementations have chosen an integer `clock_t` size that overflows early and often.
* The standard does seem to require that the overflow condition is detected and that the corresponding return value shall be that of failure `(clock_t)-1`.
* Such detection runs counter to the desired behavior of the clock counter as being that of highest implementation efficiency, and to subsequent uses across durations that do not exhibit overflow after the first occurrence.
* The suggested technical corrigendum does not appear to discuss or address this core issue and warrants further discussion. The following suggestion for the footnote is offered:
  > Implementations commonly use an integer `clock_t` type that can overflow in as
  > little as 36 minutes. All uses of `clock()` to measure a duration of time must
  > address the issue of possible overflow.

### Committee Discussion

> The paper [N1895](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1895.htm)
> was provided and discussed. The general sentiment in the committee is that
> `clock_t` is underspecified and that this function should be deprecated and
> replaced in a revision to the standard with something that uses, perhaps,
> `struct timespec`. In particular, no implementations are known to implement the
> `-1` return value on overflow.
> 
> The committee reviewed the following words and approved them as the Proposed
> Technical Corrigendum.

### Proposed Committee Response

> To question 1, such programs are not conforming and, no, the standard should not
> be altered to accept this behavior.
> 
> To question 2, no, this is not the direction.
> 
> To question 3, the committee does not agree that this invokes undefined
> behavior. The value returned under such conditions is unspecified.

### Proposed Technical Corrigendum

In 7.27.2.1p3 change:

> If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be represented,
> the function returns the value `(clock_t)(-1)`<sup>319</sup>. ...
> 
> 319\) In order to measure the time spent in a program, the `clock` function
> should be called at the start of the program and its return value subtracted
> from the value returned by subsequent calls.

to

> If the processor time used is not available, the function returns the value
> `(clock_t)(-1)`. If the value cannot be represented, the function returns an
> unspecified value<sup>319</sup>. ...
> 
> 319\) This may be due to overflow of the `clock_t` type.
