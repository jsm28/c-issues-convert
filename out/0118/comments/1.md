### Response

No, diagnostics are not required. The following Correction clarifies the intent.
Note than an implementation *may* complete the type *before* the `}`.

### Correction

***In subclause 6.5.2.2, page 61, append to Semantics:***

The enumerated type is complete at the `}` that terminates the list of
enumerator declarations.
