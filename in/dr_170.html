<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 018: Operators and punctuators
<BR> The description of operators and punctuators is confusing, and the
 constraints are contradictory.
<BR> Subclause 6.1.5 Constraints reads:
<BR> The operators <TT><B>[ ]</B></TT>, <TT><B>( )</B></TT>, and
<TT><B>? :</B></TT> shall occur  in pairs, possibly separated by
expressions. The operators <TT><B>#</B></TT>  and <TT><B>##</B></TT>
shall occur in macro-defining preprocessing directives  only.
<BR> Subclause 6.1.6 Constraints reads:
<BR> The punctuators <TT><B>[ ]</B></TT>, <TT><B>( )</B></TT>, and
<TT><B>{ }</B></TT> shall occur (after  translation phase 4) in pairs,
possibly separated by expressions,  declarations, or statements. The
punctuator <TT><B>#</B></TT> shall occur in  preprocessing directives
only.
<BR> Consider the code:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define STR(x)  #x<BR> STR ({)    /*</B><I> Line A</I> <B>*/<BR> STR (:)    /*</B>
<I>Line B</I> <B>*/<BR> STR ([)    /*</B><I> Line C</I><B> */<BR> STR (#)    /*</B><I> Line D</I><B> */</B>
</TT><BR> Line A appears to be strictly conforming, since the first
sentence  of the constraint of subclause 6.1.6 does not apply during
translation  phase 4. Line B violates the constraint of subclause 6.1.5.
The interpretation  of line C depends on whether the <TT><B>[</B></TT>
is an operator or a punctuator!
<BR> Line D violates both constraints, but again which one depends on
whether  it is an operator or a punctuator, something which is not made
clear  in the C Standard.
<BR> Assuming that the intent was for line B to be strictly conforming,
 and that <I>(after translation phase 4)</I> was inadvertently omitted 
from subclause 6.1.5, the first sentence of each of these Constraints 
is nugatory, as any program that violates these constraints also
violates  a syntax rule elsewhere in clause 6. The remaining sentences
would  be better expressed as part of subclause 6.8. It is also arguable
 that the concepts of operator and punctuator are better merged at  the
syntactic level, and separated out only at the semantic level.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR> Delete the Constraints of subclauses 6.1.5 and 6.1.6. Add the
following  constraint to 6.8:
<BR> A <TT><B>#</B></TT> preprocessing token shall only occur within
a replacement-list  or when permitted by the syntax rules of this
subclause. A <TT><B>##</B></TT>  preprocessing token shall only occur
within a replacement-list.
<BR> Add to the end of the Constraints of subclause 6.1, just before
the  full stop:
<BR> , and shall not be <TT><B>#</B></TT> or <TT><B>##</B></TT>
<BR>
<B>Alternative Suggested Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR> In subclause 6.1 syntax, delete both occurences of <I>operator</I>
 and replace the second occurence of <I>punctuator</I> by <I>pp-punctuator.</I>
<BR> Delete subclauses 6.1.5 and 6.1.6, and replace them by the
following:
<BR>
<B>6.1.5 Punctuators</B>
<BR>
<B>Syntax:</B>
<BR>
<TT>  pp-punctuator:<BR>                 punctuator<BR>              
  pp-only-punctuator<BR>         pp-only-punctuator: one of<BR>       
         # ## defined<BR>         punctuator:<BR>                 [ ]
( ) { } . - <BR>                 ++ -- & * + - ~ ! sizeof<BR>         
       / %            =  = == != ^ | && ||<BR>                 ? : , :
; ...<BR>                 = *= /= %= += -=   =   = &= ^= |=
</TT><BR>
<B>Semantics:</B>
<BR> A punctuator is a symbol that has independent syntactic and 
semantic significance. Depending on context, some punctuators may 
specify an operation to be performed (an <I>evaluation</I>) that yields
 a value, or yields a designator, or produces a side-effect, or a
combination  thereof; in that context, the punctuator is known as an <I>operator.</I>
 An <I>operand</I> is an entity on which an operator acts.
<BR> Add the following constraint to 6.8:
<BR> A <TT><B>#</B></TT> preprocessing token shall only occur within
a replacement-list  or when permitted by the syntax rules of this
subclause. A <TT><B>##</B></TT>  preprocessing token shall only occur
within a replacement-list.
<BR> Response
<BR> This is a work in progress item.
<BR> General feeling is that this should be cleaned up for C9X along
the  lines of C++ pp-punctuator grammar.
<BR> Suggested response is to add words to subclause 6.1.5 along the
lines, 
<I>shall occur in pairs within expressions...</I><BR>
