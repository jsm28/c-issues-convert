<H2>Defect Report #022</H2>
<B>Submission Date</B>: 10 Dec 92 <BR>
<B>Submittor</B>: WG14 <BR>
<B>Source</B>: X3J11/91-002 (Fred Tydeman) <BR>
<B>Question</B> 1 <BR>
What is the result of: <B><TT>strtod(&quot;100ergs&quot;, &amp;ptr);</TT></B>?
Is it 100.0 or is it 0.0? <BR>
Subclause 7.10.1.4 <B>The <TT>strtod</TT> function</B> on page 150, lines
36-38 says: ``The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence
of the input string, starting with the first non-white-space character,
that is of the expected form.'' In this case, the longest initial subsequence
of the expected form is <B><TT>100</TT></B>, so <B><TT>100.0</TT></B> should
be the return value. Also, since the entire string is in memory, <B><TT>strtod</TT></B>
can scan it as many times as need be to find the longest valid initial
subsequence. <BR>
Subclause 7.9.6.2 <B>The <TT>fscanf</TT> function</B> on page 136, lines
17-18 says: ``<B><TT>e</TT></B>,<B><TT>f</TT></B>,<B><TT>g</TT></B> Matches
an optionally signed floating-point number, whose format is the same as
expected for the subject string of the <B><TT>strtod</TT></B> function.''
Later, page 138, lines 6, 16, and 25 show that <B><TT>100ergs</TT></B>
fails to match <B><TT>%f</TT></B>. Those two show that <B><TT>100ergs</TT></B>
is invalid to <B><TT>fscanf</TT></B> and therefore, invalid to <B><TT>strtod</TT></B>.
Then, subclause 7.10.1.4, page 151, lines 11-12, ``If no conversion could
be performed, zero is returned'' indicates for an error input, 0.0 should
be returned. The reason this is invalid is spelled out in the rationale
document, subclause 7.9.6.2 <B>The <TT>fscanf</TT> function</B>, page 85:
``One-character pushback is sufficient for the implementation of <B><TT>fscanf</TT></B>.
Given the invalid field <B><TT>-.x</TT></B>, the characters <B><TT>-.</TT></B>
are not pushed back.'' And later, ``The conversions performed by <B><TT>fscanf</TT></B>
are compatible with those performed by <B><TT>strtod</TT></B> and <B><TT>strtol</TT></B>.''
<BR>
So, do <B><TT>strtod</TT></B> and <B><TT>fscanf</TT></B> act alike and
both accept and fail on the same inputs, by the one-character pushback
scanning strategy, or do they use different scanning strategies and <B><TT>strtod</TT></B>
accept more than <B><TT>fscanf</TT></B>? <BR>
<B>Correction</B> <BR>
<B><I>In subclause 7.9.6.2, page 135, lines 31-33, change:</I></B> <BR>
An input item is defined as the longest matching sequence of input characters,
unless that exceeds a specified field width, in which case it is the initial
subsequence of that length in the sequence. <BR>
<B><I>to:</I></B> <BR>
An input item is defined as the longest sequence of input characters which
does not exceed any specified field width and which is, or is a prefix
of, a matching input sequence. <BR>
<B><I>In subclause 7.9.6.2, page 137, delete:</I></B> <BR>
If conversion terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending
input character is left unread in the input stream. <BR>
<B><I>Add to subclause 7.9.6.2, page 137:</I></B> <BR>
If conversion terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending
input character is left unread in the input stream.* [Footnote *: <B><TT>fscanf</TT></B>
pushes back at most one input character onto the input stream. Therefore,
some sequences that are acceptable to <B><TT>strtod</TT></B>, <B><TT>strtol</TT></B>,
or <B><TT>strtoul</TT></B> are unacceptable to <B><TT>fscanf</TT></B>.]
