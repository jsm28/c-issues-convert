     <b>Version:</b> 1.6<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2007-09-06<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> Definition of variably modified types</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b></p>

    <p>Variably modified types are defined by 6.7.5#3:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [#3] A <i>full declarator</i> is a declarator that is not
      part of another declarator. The end of a full declarator is a
      sequence point. If the nested sequence of declarators in a
      full declarator contains a variable length array type, the
      type specified by the full declarator is said to be
      <i>variably modified</i>.
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is desirable for the definition to look at the declarator
    rather than just the resulting type, so that function
    parameters adjusted from array to pointer type are variably
    modified if the array size is variable: in</p>
<pre>
    void
    f (int i, int a[static ++i])
    {
      // ...
    }
</pre>

    <p>the increment of <code>i</code> must be evaluated for the
    definition of <code>static</code> in this context to make
    sense. However, what it means for the declarators to "contain"
    a type is unclear. The natural interpretation is that they
    include an array declarator with array size <code>[*]</code> or
    an expression which is not an integer constant expression.
    However, this does not cover cases such as</p>
<pre>
    int x;
    // ...
    typedef int vla[x];
    vla y[3];
</pre>

    <p>where a typedef for a variably modified type is used.
    <code>y</code> is a VLA, and clearly ought to be variably
    modified, but nothing about the declarators makes it variably
    modified; only the declaration specifier does so.</p>

    <p><b>Committee Discussion</b> (for history only)</p>

    <p>Declarators don't contain a type, it is the sequence of
    declarators that contains types.</p>

    <p>The sentence in 6.7.5;p3 that defines variably modified
    types may be wrong, and that may not even be the right place
    for it to be defined. The definition ties it too closely to the
    declarator. In the example provided in the DR, the type of
    <code><b>y</b></code> is variably modified. The declarator for
    <code><b>y</b></code> does not include a variable length array
    type. Para 3 needs to have it's wording adjusted in some
    fashion, the text there is insufficient to provide us the
    answer.</p>

    <p>The definition in the standard for variable length array
    does not seem to be in italics.</p>

    <p>2006-Mar-29:</p>

    <p>For the reason noted in the Summary, variably modified types
    do need to be tied to the declarator syntax.&nbsp; But the
    current definition fails to state that a new type derived from
    a variably modified type is itself variably modified.</p>

    <p><b>Commitee Response</b></p>

    <p>Yes, this is a defect in the definition..&nbsp; The
    definition will be modified to state explicitly that types
    derived from a variably modified type are themselves variably
    modified.<br>
     &nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>[<strong>Note</strong>, these are relative to wg14's <a

    "http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf">N1124</a>.]</p>

    <p>Change 3rd sentence in 6.7.5p3 from:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If the nested sequence of declarators in a full declarator
      contains a variable length array type, the type specified by
      the full declarator is said to be <i>variably
      modified</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>to</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If in the nested sequence of declarators in a full
      declarator there is a declarator specifying a variable length
      array type, the type specified by the full declarator is said
      to be <i>variably modified</i>.&nbsp; Furthermore, any type
      derived by declarator type derivation from a variably
      modified type is itself variably modified.</p>
