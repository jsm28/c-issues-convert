Item 8 - enumerated types
<BR>
The C Standard states (in effect) that an enumerated type is a set 
of integer constant values (subclause 6.1.2.5). It also states that 
an enumerated type must be compatible with an implementation-defined 
integer type (subclause 6.5.2.2). Finally, the integral promotions 
(subclause 6.2.1.1) convert an enumerated type to <TT><B>signed</B></TT> or 
<TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT>. Consider:
<BR>
<TT><B>enum foo { foo_A = 0, foo_B = 1, foo_C = 8 };<BR>
enum bar { bar_A = -10, bar_B = 10 };<BR>
enum qux { qux_A = UCHAR_MAX * 4, qux_B };
<BR></B></TT>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> If any value between zero and <TT><B>SCHAR_MAX</B></TT> (inclusive) is 
assigned to a variable of type <TT><B>enum foo</B></TT>, and the value of the 
variable is then converted to type <TT><B>int</B></TT> or <TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT>, 
does the C Standard require the original value to result; or is the 
implementation permitted or required to convert it to one of the three 
values 0, 1, and 8; or is the result of the assignment undefined?
<LI> Can a conforming implementation require all enumerated types 
to be compatible with a single type?
<LI> If the answer to (b) is ``yes,'' and assuming that the 
value <TT><B>UCHAR_MAX * 4</B></TT> is less than <TT><B>SHRT_MAX</B></TT> is the declaration 
of the type <TT><B>enum qux</B></TT> strictly conforming, or can a conforming 
implementation require all enumerated types to be compatible with 
a single type which is a character type?
<LI> Can an implementation make the type that <TT><B>enum bar</B></TT> is compatible 
with be an unsigned type, even though it uses an enumeration constant 
not representable in that type?
<LI> Can an implementation make the type that <TT><B>enum qux</B></TT> is compatible 
with be either of <TT><B>signed char</B></TT> or <TT><B>unsigned char</B></TT>, even though 
it uses an enumeration constant not representable in that type?
<LI> If the answer to (d) or (e) is ``yes,'' what is the effect 
of making one of the enumeration constants of an enumerated type outside 
the range of the compatible type? What is the effect of assigning 
the value of that constant to an object of the enumerated type?
<LI> Can the type that an enumerated type is compatible with be <TT><B>signed</B></TT> 
or <TT><B>unsigned long</B></TT>? If so, what are the effects of the integral 
promotions on a value of that type?
<LI> If an implementation is allowed to add other types to the list 
of integer types (see items 4(b) and (c)), then can the type that 
an enumerated type is compatible with be such a type?
</Ol>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
a) Every enumerated type is compatible with some integer type (subclause 
6.5.2.2). When conversion takes place between compatible types, values 
are not altered (subclause 6.2). So for values between 0 and <TT><B>SCHAR_MAX</B></TT>, 
the original value must result, because no matter what type is chosen, 
the value can be expressed in that type.
<BR>
b) Yes it can.
<BR>
c-g) It is the intention of the C Standard that all the members of 
the enumeration be representable in the enumerated type, and that 
the compatible integer type be one which promotes to <TT><B>int</B></TT> or 
<TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT>.
<BR>
h) An implementation is not allowed to add other types to the list.

<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>In subclause 6.5.2.2, page 61, second paragraph of Semantics, 
change:</B></I>
<BR>
Each enumerated type shall be compatible with an integer type; the 
choice of type is implementation-defined.
<BR>
<I><B>to:</B></I>
<BR>
Each enumerated type shall be compatible with an integer type. The 
choice of type is implementation-defined, but shall be capable of 
representing the values of all the members of the enumeration.
