<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
I'll give you the short form first. I can haul out lots of related 
material if it becomes necessary, but perhaps the bare question is 
enough. Is the following program strictly conforming?
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdlib.h><BR>
<BR>
struct A {<BR>
	char x[1];<BR>
	};<BR>
<BR>
main()<BR>
	{<BR>
	struct A *p = (struct A *) malloc(sizeof(struct A) + 100);<BR>
	p->>x[5] = '?';		/*</B><I> This is the key line </I><B>*/<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
<BR></B></TT>
If I remember correctly from reading the C Standard, pointer arithmetic 
is illegal if it results in an address outside the object to which 
the original pointer refers. The question here is essentially whether 
the ``object'' is all the memory returned by <TT><B>malloc</B></TT> or 
the single <TT><B>char</B></TT> denoted by <TT><B>p->>x[0]</B></TT>.
<BR>
I do not believe there is any language in the C Standard that clearly 
answers this question. I understand that this particular programming 
technique is quite common, but that is more likely to affect whether 
a program is ``conforming'' than whether it is ``strictly 
conforming.''
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Subclause 6.3.2.1 describes limitations on pointer arithmetic, in 
connection with array subscripting. (See also subclause 6.3.6.) Basically, 
it permits an implementation to tailor how it <I>represents pointers</I> 
to the size of the objects they point at. Thus, the expression <TT><B>p->>x[5]</B></TT> 
may fail to designate the expected byte, even though the <TT><B>malloc</B></TT> 
call ensures that the byte is present. The idiom, while common, is 
<I>not</I> strictly conforming.
<BR>
A safer idiom is:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdlib.h><BR>
#define HUGE_ARR	10000	/*</B><I> largest desired array </I><B>*/<BR>
<BR>
struct A {<BR>
	char x[HUGE_ARR];<BR>
	};<BR>
<BR>
main()<BR>
	{<BR>
	struct A *p = (struct A *) malloc(sizeof(struct A)<BR>
		- HUGE_ARR + 100);	/*</B><I> want x[100] this time </I><B>*/<BR>
	p->>x[5] = '?';		/*</B><I> now strictly conforming </I><B>*/<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
</B></TT>
