<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
Defining <TT><B>NULL</B></TT>
<BR>
Subclause 7.1.6 defines <TT><B>NULL</B></TT> to be a macro ``which expands 
to an implementation-defined null pointer constant.'' Subclause 
6.2.2.3 defines a null pointer constant to be ``an integral constant 
expression with the value 0, or such an expression cast to type <TT><B>void 
*</B></TT>.'' The expression <TT><B>4-4</B></TT> is an integral constant expression 
with the value 0. Therefore, Standard C appears to permit
<BR>
<TT>#define NULL	4 - 4
</TT>
as one of the ways <TT><B>NULL</B></TT> can be defined in the standard headers. 
By allowing such a definition, Standard C forces programmers to parenthesize 
<TT><B>NULL</B></TT> in several contexts if they wish to ensure portability. 
For example, when <TT><B>NULL</B></TT> is cast to a pointer type, <TT><B>NULL</B></TT> 
must be parenthesized in the cast expression.
<BR>
At least one book about Standard C suggests defining <TT><B>NULL</B></TT> as
<BR>
<TT>#define NULL	(void *) 0
</TT>
That definition leads to a subtler version of the problem described 
above. Consider the expression <TT><B>NULL[p]</B></TT>, where <TT><B>p</B></TT> is an 
array of pointers. The expression expands to <TT><B>(void *)0[p]</B></TT> which 
is equivalent to <TT><B>(void *)(p[0])</B></TT>. I doubt many users would expect 
such a result.
<BR>
Have I correctly understood Standard C's requirements regarding <TT><B>NULL</B></TT>? 
If not, what are those requirements?
<BR>
<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>Add to subclause 7.1.2, page 96 (before Forward references):</B></I>
<BR>
Any definition of an object-like macro described in this clause shall 
expand to code that is fully protected by parentheses where necessary, 
so that it groups in an arbitrary expression as if it were a single 
identifier.
<BR>
<B>Question</B> 2
<BR>
Subclause 7.1.3 implies that an identifier that begins with an underscore 
cannot be defined as a macro name in any source file that includes 
at least one standard header. Footnote 91 emphasizes this restriction. 
Nonetheless, there are texts on Standard C that imply that such macro 
definitions are allowed.
<BR>
The first paragraph of subclause 7.1.3 states that each header optionally 
declares or defines identifiers which are always reserved either for 
any use or for use as file scope identifiers. The second bullet item 
states, ``All identifiers that begin with an underscore are always 
reserved for use as identifiers with file scope in both the ordinary 
identifier and tag name spaces.'' The final sentence states, ``If 
the program declares or defines an identifier with the same name as 
an identifier reserved in that context (other than as allowed by 7.1.7), 
the behavior is undefined.'' Taken together, these statements imply 
that an identifier that starts with an underscore cannot be defined 
as a macro in a source file that includes at least one of the standard 
headers.
<BR>
Can an identifier that starts with an underscore be defined as a macro 
in a source file that includes at least one standard header?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
No. See subclause 7.1.3 and Footnote 91.
