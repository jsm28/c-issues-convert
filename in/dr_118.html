ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg25:
<BR>
Subject: Completion point for enumerated types.
<BR>
Are diagnostics required for the following code examples?
<BR>
<TT><B>enum E1 { enumerator1 = sizeof (enum E1) };<BR>
enum E2 { enumerator2 = sizeof (enum E2 *) };
</B></TT><BR>
(Just read on! This <I>isn't</I> just the same old question again!)
<BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.3.3.4 (<B>Constraints</B>):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> operator shall not be applied to an expression 
that has function type or an incomplete type, to the parenthesized 
name of such a type, ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Subclause 6.5.2.1 (<B>Semantics</B>):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The [structure or union] type
is incomplete until after the <TT><B>}</B></TT> 
that terminates the list [of member declarations].''
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(Bracketed portions added for clarity.)
<BR>
CIB #1, RFI #13, response to question #5:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>enum e { a = sizeof(enum e) };
</B></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
the relevant citations are subclause 6.1.2.1 starting on page 
21, line 39, indicating that the scope of the first <TT><B>e</B></TT> begins 
at the <TT><B>{</B></TT>, and subclause 6.5.2.2, page 62, line 20, which attributes 
meaning to a later <TT><B>enum e</B></TT> <I>only if</I> this use appears in 
a <I>subsequent</I> declaration. By subsequent, we mean ``after 
the <TT><B>}</B></TT>.'' Because in this case, the second <TT><B>enum e</B></TT> is 
not in a subsequent declaration, and no other wording in the C Standard 
addresses the meaning, the C Standard has left this example in the 
category of undefined behavior.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Please note that the above response to RFI #13, question #5 has totally 
failed to solve the <I>real</I> problem with the current wording of 
the C Standard.
<BR>
The <I>real</I> problem is that (unlike the case for structure and union 
type definitions) nothing in the C Standard presently indicates where 
(or whether) an enumerated type becomes ``completed.''
<BR>
This is a very serious flaw in the current C Standard. Given that 
the C Standard currently contains no statement(s) which specify where 
(or whether) an enumerated type becomes a ``completed'' type, any 
and all programs which use <I>any</I> enumerated type in <I>any</I> context 
requiring a completed type are, by definition, <I>not</I> strictly 
conforming. (This will come as quite a shock to a number of C 
programmers!)
<BR>
I feel that the Committee must resolve this serious problem as soon 
as possible. The only plausible way to do that is to add a statement 
to subclause 6.5.2.2 which will specify the point at which an enum 
type become a ``completed'' type.
<BR>
Using the statement currently given in subclause 6.5.2.1 (relating 
to struct and union types) as a guide, it would appear that subclause 
6.5.2.2 should be amended to include the following new semantic rule:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The enum type is incomplete until after the <TT><B>}</B></TT> that terminates 
the list of enumerators.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Some such addition is obviously necessary in order to render enum 
types usable as complete types within strictly conforming 
programs.
<BR>
Note however that such a clarification would have the additional (beneficial?) 
side effect of rendering the following declaration subject to a mandatory 
diagnostic (due to the violation of the constraints for the operand 
of the <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> operator):
<BR>
<TT><B>enum E1 { enumerator1 = sizeof (enum E1) };
</B></TT><BR>
Even after such a clarification however, the status of:
<BR>
<TT><B>enum E2 { enumerator2 = sizeof (enum E2 *) };
</B></TT><BR>
is still questionable at best, and the proper interpretation for such 
a case should, I believe, still be drawn from the response given to 
<A HREF="dr_013.html#Question5">RFI #13, question #5</A>; 
i.e., such examples should be viewed as involving undefined behavior.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
No, diagnostics are not required. The following Correction clarifies
the intent. Note than an implementation <I>may</I> complete the
type <I>before</I> the <TT><B>}</B></TT>.
<BR>
<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>In subclause 6.5.2.2, page 61, append to Semantics:</B></I>
<BR>
The enumerated type is complete at the <TT><B>}</B></TT> that terminates
the list of enumerator declarations.
