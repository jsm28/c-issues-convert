     <b>Submitter:</b> UK C Panel<br>
     <b>Submission Date:</b> 2001-09-07<br>
     <b>Source:</b> Clive D.W. Feather &lt;clive@demon.net&gt;<br>
     <b>Version:</b> 1.1<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2002-03-06<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> multiple inclusion of headers</p>
    <b>Problem</b> 

    <p>Consider the code:</p>
<pre>
<tt><b>   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;     //</b> <i>Line 1</i> <b>  
    #undef FOPEN_MAX       //</b> <i>Line 2, permitted by 7.1.3#3</i> <b>   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;     //</b> <i>Line 3</i> <b>   #ifdef FOPEN_MAX       //</b> <i>Line 4</i> 
</tt>
</pre>

    <p>7.1.2 says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [#4] Standard headers may be included in any order; each may
      be included more than once in a given scope, with no effect
      different from being included only once, except that the
      effect of including <tt><b>&lt;assert.h&gt;</b></tt> depends
      on the definition of <tt><b>NDEBUG</b></tt> (see 7.2).
    </blockquote>

    <p>Does "with no effect different" mean:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>the includes on lines 1 and 3 have the same effect, so at
      line 4 the macro <tt><b>FOPEN_MAX</b></tt> is defined;</li>

      <li>the include on line 3 has no effect, so that at line 4
      the macro <tt><b>FOPEN_MAX</b></tt> is undefined;</li>

      <li>something else ?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Most current implementations wrap the contents of headers
    with an "idempotent guard", such as:</p>
<pre>
<tt><b>   #ifndef _STDIO_H_INCLUDED_
    #define _STDIO_H_INCLUDED_
    //</b> <i>Real contents go here</i> <b>  #endif
</b></tt>
</pre>
    This will provide behaviour (2), which I would suggest is the
    most desirable. 

    <p>Furthermore, the concept of scope doesn't apply here, both
    because includes happen during preprocessing and because there
    is a requirement in the same paragraph that:</p>

    <blockquote>
      If used, a header shall be included outside of any external
      declaration or definition,
    </blockquote>

    <p>If the wording is being altered, this would be a good
    opportunity to fix this as well.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change the first sentence of 7.1.2#4 to:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#4] Standard headers may be included in any order; each
      may be included any number of times in a preprocessing
      translation unit. The second and subsequent occurrences of a
      given header shall be ignored, except in the case of
      <tt><b>&lt;assert.h&gt;</b></tt> (where the behaviour is
      defined in subclause 7.2).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>The Committee believe that both answer 1 and 2 are allowed,
    and does not see a compelling reason to change this.</p>
