<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 030: Nugatory constraint
<BR>
<I>[BSI characterize this issue as minor.]</I>
<BR> The constraint of 6.1.2 serves no purpose. Subclause 6.1.2 states 
in part:
<BR>
<B>Constraints</B>
<BR> In translation phases 7 and 8, an identifier shall not consist  of
the same sequence of characters as a keyword.
<BR>
<B>Semantics</B>
<BR> ... When preprocessing tokens are converted to tokens during 
translation phase 7, if a preprocessing token could be converted to 
either a keyword or an identifier, it is converted to a keyword.
<BR> Given the latter text [added in Technical Corrigendum 1, reference

<A HREF=dr_017.html#Question39>DR 017 Q39</A>], the constraint can never be violated.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</B>
<BR> Delete the constraint in subclause 6.1.2.
<BR> Suggested Future Change
<BR> Delete the constraint in subclause 6.1.2.<BR>
