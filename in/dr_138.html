<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Subclause 6.1.2.4 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An object has a <I>storage duration</I> that determines its lifetime. 
There are two storage durations: static and automatic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
To me that clearly excludes heap objects. Is there a Defect Report 
on that? If so which one? (I have responses to Defect Report #001 
through Defect Report #059.) If not and something else in the Standard 
fixes it, can you point out where?

There are three storage durations: static, automatic, and allocated. 
Allocated storage is described in 7.10.3.
