<B>Question</B>
<BR>
I've discovered an apparent bug in the C Standard. The code snippet:
<BR>
<TT><B>struct {const int a[5]; } s1, s2;<BR>
void f(void) {s1 = s2; }
</B></TT><BR>
can be contained in a strictly conforming program, which runs counter 
to my understanding of the meaning of ``const-qualification.'' 
That occurs because, according to subclause 6.5.3, the member <TT><B>s1.a</B></TT> 
is <I>not</I> const-qualified and thus slips past the modifiable-lvalue 
definition in subclause 6.2.2.1. Subclause 6.5.3 says that the <I>elements</I> 
of the array <TT><B>s1.a</B></TT> are const-qualified, not the array itself, 
and I can find no reasonable way to construe <TT><B>s1.a[3]</B></TT>, for example, 
as a ``member'' of <TT><B>s1</B></TT>; its only member is <TT><B>s1.a</B></TT>, 
as I see it. Apparently, the C Standard does not define the term ``member,'' 
except implicitly through its use in subclause 6.3.2.3 <B>Semantics</B>, 
which says that <TT><B>s1.a</B></TT> is the member (on which the subscripting 
operator can operate to extract an element, but the element is not 
a member of the structure.)
<BR>
What I think is desirable would be a required diagnostic for this 
example, as it <I>should</I> be considered to violate the constraint 
in subclause 6.3.16 that requires the left operand of an assignment 
operator to be a modifiable lvalue.

Relevant citations:
<BR>
Subclause 6.2.2.1 <B>Lvalues and function designators</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A <I>modifiable lvalue</I> is an lvalue that does not have array 
type, does not have an incomplete type, does not have a const-qualified 
type, and if it is a structure or union, does not have any member 
(including, recursively, any member of all contained structures or 
unions) with a const-qualified type.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Subclause 6.3.16 <B>Assignment operators</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Constraints</B>:
<BR>
An assignment operator shall have a modifiable lvalue as its 
left operand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Subclause 6.5.3 <B>Type qualifiers</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the specification of an array type includes any type qualifiers, 
the element type is so-qualified, not the array type. If the specification 
of a function type includes any type qualifiers, the behavior is undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The example code is <I>not</I> strictly conforming, because some objects 
(the elements of the array <TT><B>s1.a</B></TT>) are being modified through 
use of an lvalue (<TT><B>s1</B></TT>) with non-const-qualified type, which according 
to subclause 6.5.3 results in undefined behavior.
<BR>
However, a diagnostic is indeed desired here.

<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>In subclause 6.2.2.1, page 36,
change the parenthetic remark in the
final sentence of the first paragraph:</B></I>
<BR>
(including, recursively, any member of all contained structures or 
unions)
<BR>
<I><B>to:</B></I>
<BR>
(including, recursively, any member or element of all contained aggregates 
or unions)
