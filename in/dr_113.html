<B>Question</B>
<BR>
ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg20:
<BR>
Subject: Return expressions in functions declared to return qualified 
<TT><B>void</B></TT>.
<BR>
a) Does the following code involve usage which requires 
a diagnostic from a conforming implementation?
<BR>
b) Does the following code involve usage which renders the 
code itself not strictly conforming?
<BR>
<TT><B>volatile void func0 (volatile void *vvp)<BR>
	{<BR>
	return *vvp;	/*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	}<BR>
 <BR>
const void func1 (const void *cvp)<BR>
	{<BR>
	return *cvp;	/*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.6.6.4 (<B>Constraints</B>):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A <TT><B>return</B></TT> statement with an expression
shall not appear in a function whose 
return type is <TT><B>void</B></TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that this constraint doesn't say anything about functions declared 
to return some qualified version of the <TT><B>void</B></TT> type.
<BR>
I believe that it was probably the Committee's true intent to require 
a diagnostic for any attempt to specify an expression in a return 
statement within any function declared to return <I>any</I> qualified 
or unqualified version of the <TT><B>void</B></TT> type (and indeed, many existing 
implementations do already issue diagnostics for usage such as that 
shown in the example above). Thus, it would seem appropriate for the 
Committee to amend the above quoted constraint
(from subclause 6.6.6.4) to read:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A <TT><B>return</B></TT> statement with an expression shall not appear 
in a function whose return type is a void type.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
a) Yes, a diagnostic is required.
<BR>
b) Yes, this renders the program not strictly conforming 
code.
<BR>
A qualified <TT><B>void</B></TT> function return type
is disallowed by the constraints of subclause 6.7.1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The return type from a function shall be <TT><B>void</B></TT>
or an object type other than array.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The constraint does not say ``a void type'' and thus <TT><B>void</B></TT> 
must not be qualified when used as a function return type. Since a 
qualified <TT><B>void</B></TT> return type
is already invalid, there is no need for 
the additional constraint on the
<TT><B>return</B></TT> statement (subclause 6.6.6.4).
