ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg6:
<BR>
Subclause 6.2.1.5 explicitly allows an implementation to evaluate 
a floating-point expression using some type which has <I>more</I> 
precision than the apparent type of the expression itself:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The values of floating operands and the results of floating 
expressions may be represented in greater precision and range than 
that required by the type, ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
A footnote on this rule also says explicitly that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The cast and assignment operators still must perform their specified 
conversions, as described in 6.2.1.3 and 6.2.1.4.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
As noted in the first of these two quotes (above) some compilers (most 
notably for x86 and mc680x0 target systems) may perform floating-point 
expression evaluation using a type which has more precision and/or 
range than that of the ``apparent type'' of the expression being 
evaluated.
<BR>
The clear implication of the above rules is that compilers must sometimes 
generate code to implement narrowing of floating-point expression 
results, when (a) those results were generated using a format with 
more precision and/or range than the ``apparent type'' of the 
expression would seem to call for, and where (b) the expression result 
is the operand of a cast or is used as an operand of an ``assignment 
operator.''
<BR>
My question is simply this: For the purposes of the above rules, does 
the term ``assignment operator'' mean exactly (and only) those 
operators listed in subclause 6.3.3.16, or should implementors and 
users expect that other operations described within the C Standard 
as being similar to ``assignment'' will also produce floating-point 
narrowing effects (under the right conditions)?
<BR>
Specifically, may (or must) implicit floating-point narrowing occur 
as a result of parameter passing if the actual argument expression 
is evaluated in a format which is wider than its ``apparent type?'' 
May (or must) implicit floating-point narrowing occur as a result 
of a <TT><B>return</B></TT> statement if the <TT><B>return</B></TT> statement contains 
a floating-point expression which is evaluated in some format which 
is wider than its ``apparent type?''
<BR>
Here are two examples illustrating these two questions. Imagine that 
these examples will be compiled for a type of target system which 
is capable of performing floating-point addition <I>only</I> on floating-point 
operands which are represented in the same floating-point format normally 
used to hold type <TT><B>long double</B></TT> operands in C:
<BR>
Example 1:
<BR>
<TT><B>extern void callee ();	/*</B><I> non-prototyped </I><B>*/<BR>
double a, b;<BR>
<BR>
void caller ()<BR>
	{<BR>
	callee(a+b);  /*</B><I> evaluated in long double then narrowed? </I><B>*/<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
Example 2:
<BR>
<TT><B>double a, b;<BR>
<BR>
double returner ()<BR>
	{<BR>
	return a+b;  /*</B><I> evaluated in long double then narrowed? </I><B>*/<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
A careful reading of the C Standard indicates that everything that 
is done ``as if by assignment'' must pass through a knot-hole 
(be narrowed). See the following references: subclause 6.3.16 for 
assignment, 6.3.2.2 for parameters, and 6.6.6.4 for return types.
