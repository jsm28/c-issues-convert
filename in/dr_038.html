<H2>Defect Report #038</H2>

<P><B>Submission Date</B>: 10 Dec 92 <BR>
<B>Submittor</B>: WG14 <BR>
<B>Source</B>: X3J11/91-046 (Kuo-Wei Lee) <BR>
<B>Question</B> 1 <BR>
Under subclause 6.8.3.1 <B>Argument substitution</B>, the C Standard states
on page 90, lines 12-14: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Before being substituted, each argument's preprocessing tokens are completely
macro replaced as if they form the rest of the translation unit; no other
preprocessing tokens are available. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is not clear to us what should happen if, after the first replacement,
the argument is a valid preprocessing number. Consider the following example:
<BR>
<B><TT>#define X 0x000E<BR>
#define Y 0x0100<BR>
#define FOO(a) a<BR>
FOO(X+Y) <BR>
</TT></B>After <B><TT>X</TT></B> is replaced, <B><TT>FOO(X+Y)</TT></B>
becomes <B><TT>FOO(0x000E+Y)</TT></B>. At this point, should the macro
replacement continue and expand <B><TT>Y</TT></B> to be 0x0100 with the
final result being <B><TT>FOO(0x000E+0x0100)</TT></B>; or should the expansion
stop since <B><TT>0x000E+Y</TT></B> is a syntactically valid preprocessing
number? <BR>
In other words, should <B><TT>FOO(X+Y)</TT></B> be expanded into <B><TT>FOO(0x000E+0x0100)</TT></B>,
or should it be <B><TT>FOO(0x000E+Y)</TT></B>? <BR>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
Subclause 5.1.1.2, page 5, lines 32-39 indicate that translation must proceed
as if all creation of preprocessing tokens completes before any macro expansion
begins. These are translation phases 3 and 4: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens and sequences
of white-space characters (including comments)... <BR>
4. Preprocessing directives are executed and macro invocations are expanded.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore, if <B><TT>X+Y</TT></B> were expanded to <B><TT>0x000E+Y</TT></B>,
a new preprocessing number would not be created. The macro expansion proceeds
as follows. <BR>
<B><TT>FOO(X+Y) <I>(6 tokens) --<BR>
</I>FOO(0x000E+0x0100) <I>(6 tokens) --<BR>
</I>0x000E+0x0100 <I>(3 tokens)</I> <BR>
</TT></B>This sequence is required by subclause 6.8.3.1, page 90, lines
10-14: <BLOCKQUOTE>
A parameter in the replacement list ... is replaced by the corresponding
argument after all macros contained therein have been expanded. Before
being substituted, each argument's preprocessing tokens are completely
macro replaced as if they formed the rest of the translation unit...
