<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 002: Consistency of implementation-defined values
<BR> The restrictions that apply to "implementation-defined" entities 
are not clear.
<BR> What restrictions apply to implementation-defined entities? If the
 value of an expression is implementation-defined, need the
implementation  always produce the same result?
<BR> For example, the value of the expressions <TT><B>7/-3</B></TT>
and <TT><B>8/-3</B></TT>  must each be either <TT><B>3</B></TT> or
<TT><B>2</B></TT>. Can an implementation make them  different (that
is, use a different implementation-defined choice  for each), or must it
make the same choice for all integral divisions  involving a negative
quantity?
<BR> As another example, can the number of significant characters and
the  significance of case in an identifier with external linkage depend 
on the identifier itself, or must it be the same for all possible 
identifiers?
<BR> Response
<BR> "Implementation defined" means just that: an implementation  can
define any behavior even though it may not be constant.<BR>
