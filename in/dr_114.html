<B>Question</B>
<BR>
ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg21:
<BR>
Subject: Initialization of multi-dimensional <TT><B>char</B></TT> array objects.
<BR>
a) Does the following code involve usage which requires 
a diagnostic from a conforming implementation?
<BR>
b) Does the following code involve usage which renders the 
code itself not strictly conforming?
<BR>
<TT><B>char array2[2][5] = { "defghi" };	/*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/</B></TT>
<BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.5.7 (<B>Constraints</B>):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There shall be no more initializers in an initializer list than 
there are objects to be initialized.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Subclause 6.5.7:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An array of character type may be initialized by a character 
string literal, optionally enclosed in braces.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Subclause 6.5.7 (examples):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... It defines a three-dimensional array object; ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It appears that many existing compilers seem to feel the the code 
example shown above violates the ``no more initializers'' constraint 
(quoted above) which is given in subclause 6.5.7.
<BR>
Note however that the <I>entire</I> two-dimensional array object being 
initialized consists of exactly 2*5 = 10 individual <TT><B>char</B></TT> objects, 
whereas the initializer itself only consists of 7 individual <TT><B>char</B></TT> 
values (if one counts the terminating null byte). Thus, it would appear 
that these existing implementations are in fact <I>wrong</I> in rejecting 
the above code, and that such usage is in fact strictly conforming.
<BR>
I ask the Committee to unambiguously either confirm or refute that 
position.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
a) Yes, a diagnostic is required.
<BR>
b) Yes, this renders the program not strictly conforming.
<BR>
Note that initialization of an array of character type by a string
literal is a special case, described in subclause 6.5.7.
<BR>
The phrases ``two-dimensional array'' and ``three-dimensional 
array'' are merely used for convenience. The <B>Semantics</B> section 
on array declarators (subclause 6.5.4.2) and the syntax specification 
in the section on declarations (subclause 6.5.4) clearly show that 
array types must be declared with one index. Thus, an array which 
has two indices must be considered an ``array of array of type.''
<BR>
Since this is the case, the <B>Semantics</B> description for initializing 
aggregates and subaggregates in subclause 6.5.7 applies. This description 
states
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the initializer of a subaggregate or the first member of 
the contained union begins with a left brace, the initialiers enclosed 
by that brace and its matching right brace initialize the members 
of the subaggregate or the first member of the contained union.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, in the example, the string must be applied only to the first 
element of the two-element array (which is an array of 5 characters). 
Since the initializer contains 6 characters, it violates the constraint 
of the same section which states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There shall be no more initializers in an initializer list than 
there are objects to be initialized.
