<B>Question</B>
<BR>
ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg8:
<BR>
Subclause 6.3.2.2 <B>Function calls</B> says:
<BR>
If the expression that denotes the called function has a type 
that includes a prototype, the arguments are implicitly converted, 
as if by assignment, to the types of the corresponding parameters.
<BR>
The problem with this statement is the phrase ``as if by assignment.'' 
The above rule fails to yield an unambiguous meaning in cases where 
an assignment of the actual to the formal would be prohibited by other 
rules of the language, as in:
<BR>
<TT><B>void callee (const int formal);<BR>
int actual;<BR>
void caller () { callee(actual); }
</B></TT><BR>
(Here, the name of the formal parameter <TT><B>formal</B></TT> may be initialized 
but not assigned to, because it is a non-modifiable lvalue.)
<BR>
A similar problem exists within subclause 6.6.6.4 <B>The <TT>return</TT> 
statement</B>. It says:
<BR>
If the expression has a type different from that of the function 
in which it appears, it is converted as if it were assigned to an 
object of that type.
<BR>
This statement leaves the validity of the following code open to question:
<BR>
<TT><B>
const int returner () { return 99; }
</B></TT><BR>
Last but not least, subclause 6.5.7 <B>Initialization</B> says:
<BR>
The initializer for a scalar shall be a single expression, optionally 
enclosed in braces. The initial value of the object is that of the 
expression; the same type constraints and conversions as for simple 
assignment apply, ...
<BR>
This statement leaves the validity of the following code open to question:
<BR>
<TT><B>const int i = 99;
</B></TT><BR>
(Note that <I>assignment</I> to the data object <TT><B>i</B></TT> is not normally 
permitted, as its name does not represent a modifiable lvalue.)
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
There are three questions about mismatched type qualifiers in places 
where conversions ``as if by assignment'' takes place. Two of 
these are in initialization and in function returns. A careful reading 
of the C Standard shows that mismatched qualifiers are allowed in 
these two cases; see subclauses 6.5.7 and 6.5.3 <B>Semantics</B>.
<BR>
The other issue deals with a qualifier mismatch between arguments 
and the parameters of a called function. The C Standard should be 
modified to clarify that such a mismatch is allowed.
<BR>
<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>In subclause 6.3.2.2, page 41, second paragraph, change:</B></I>
<BR>
If the expression that denotes the called function has a type 
that includes a prototype, the arguments are implicitly converted, 
as if by assignment, to the types of the corresponding parameters.
<BR>
<I><B>to:</B></I>
<BR>
If the expression that denotes the called function has a type 
that includes a prototype, the arguments are implicitly converted, 
as if by assignment, to the types of the corresponding parameters, 
taking the type of each parameter to be the unqualified version of 
its declared type.
