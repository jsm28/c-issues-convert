ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg34:
<BR>
Subject: Composite type of an enumerated type and an integral type.
<BR>
Given the declarations:
<BR>
<TT><B>enum E { red, green, blue } object;<BR>
int object;
</B></TT><BR>
and given an implementation for which the type <TT><B>int</B></TT> is considered 
to be compatible with the type <TT><B>enum E</B></TT>, what is the composite 
type of <TT><B>object</B></TT> at the end of the translation unit which contains 
the above declarations?
<BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.5.2.2 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each enumerated type shall be compatible with an integer type; 
the choice of type implementation-defined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Subclause 6.1.2.6 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A <I>composite type</I> can be constructed from two types that are 
compatible; ...
<BR>
For an identifier with external or internal linkage declared 
in the same scope as another declaration for that identifier, the 
type of the identifier becomes the composite type.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
See <A HREF="dr_013.html#Question3">Defect Report #013, Question 3</A>.
There is no requirement that the composite type
be unique, and either of the types could be chosen as the composite type.
