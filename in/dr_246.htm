     <b>Subject:</b> completion of declarators</p>

    <p><b>Problem</b></p>

    <p>6.2.1#7 reads in part:</p>

    <blockquote>
      Any other identifier has scope that begins just after the
      completion of its declarator.
    </blockquote>

    <p>However, nothing says when a declarator is completed. While
    it seems obvious to experienced people that this means the
    syntactic end of the declarator, the term "complete" has other
    meanings when discussing declarations and objects, and
    therefore it's a bad term to use.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change the quoted text to:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Any other identifier has scope that begins just after the
      end of the full declarator it appears in.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>The suggested words don't appear to be an improvement; the
    current phrasing is clear enough.</p>
