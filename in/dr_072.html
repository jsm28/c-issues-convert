Item 9 - definition of object
<BR>
Consider the following translation unit:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdlib.h><BR>
<BR>
typedef double T;<BR>
struct hacked<BR>
	{<BR>
	int size;<BR>
	T data [1];<BR>
	};<BR>
<BR>
struct hacked *f (void);<BR>
	{<BR>
	T *pt;<BR>
	struct hacked *a;<BR>
	char *pc;<BR>
<BR>
	a = malloc (sizeof (struct hacked) + 20 * sizeof (T));<BR>
	if (a == NULL)<BR>
		return NULL;<BR>
	a->size = 20;<BR>
<BR>
	/*</B><I> Method 1 </I><B>/*<BR>
	a->data [8] = 42;					/*</B><I> Line A </I><B>/*<BR>
<BR>
	/*</B><I> Method 2 </I><B>/*<BR>
	pt = a->data;<BR>
	pt += 8;							/*</B><I> Line B </I><B>/*<BR>
	*pt = 42;<BR>
<BR>
	/*</B><I> Method 3 </I><B>/*<BR>
	pc = (char *) a;<BR>
	pc += offsetof (struct hacked, data);<BR>
	pt = (T *) pc;						/*</B><I> Line C </I><B>/*<BR>
	pt += 8;							/*</B><I> Line D </I><B>/*<BR>
	*pt = 6 * 9;<BR>
	return a;<BR>
	}

Now, <A HREF="dr_051.html"> Defect Report #051</A> has established that the assignment on line 
A involves undefined behavior.
<BR><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Is the addition on line B strictly conforming?
<BR> If the answer to (a) is ``yes,'' are the three statements 
forming ``method 2'' a valid way of implementing the <TT><B>struct 
hacked</B></TT>?
<LI> Is the cast of line C strictly conforming?
<LI> Is the addition on line D strictly conforming?
<LI> If the answer to (c) and (d) are ``yes,'' are the five 
statements forming ``method 3'' a valid way of implementing 
the <TT><B>struct hacked</B></TT>?
<P>
Now suppose that the definition of type <TT><B>T</B></TT> is changed to <TT><B>char</B></TT>. 
This means that the last bullet in subclause 6.3 (``an object shall 
have its stored value accessed only by ... a character type'') 
now applies, and furthermore it means that the location accessed is 
an integral multiple of <TT><B>sizeof(T)</B></TT> bytes from the start of the 
<TT><B>malloc</B></TT>ed object, and so constitutes an element of that object 
when viewed as an array of <TT><B>T</B></TT>.
</P>
<LI> Is the assignment on line A now strictly conforming?
<LI> What are the answers to questions (a) to (e) with this change?
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
a) <A HREF="dr_051.html">Defect Report #051</A> provides the rationale for why Line A results 
in undefined behavior. The same rules also apply to the assignment 
to <TT><B>pt</B></TT>; thus Line B results in undefined behavior
<BR>
b) Not applicable given the answer to question (a).
<BR>
c) Assignment causes the base address of the structure to be assigned 
to <TT><B>pc</B></TT>. The response to <A HREF="dr_044.html">Defect Report #044, question 1</A>, states 
that use of the <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> macro does not result in undefined 
behavior. The second line causes <TT><B>pc</B></TT> to point to member <TT><B>data</B></TT>. 
Line C does not contain any construct that would result in the program 
not being strictly conforming.
<BR>
d) Line D results in undefined behavior. See answer (a) for rationale.
<BR>
e) Not applicable given answers (c) and (d).
<BR>
f) Subclause 6.3 contains additional restrictions, not permissions.
<BR>
g) The answers to questions (a)-(e) are not affected if <TT><B>T</B></TT> has 
<TT><B>char</B></TT> type.
