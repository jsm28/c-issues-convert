<BR> Defect Report UK 003: Zero-sized allocations
<BR> The use of the word "unique" in subclause 7.10.3 is ambiguous, 
and the handling of zero size allocations is incomplete.
<BR>
<B>Part 1</B>
<BR> Subclause 7.10.3 reads
<BR> If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is 
implementation-defined; the value returned shall be either a null 
pointer or a unique pointer.
<BR> Does the term "unique" mean "different every time,"  or does it
mean "there is a single pointer returned by all calls  with size zero"
(as might be presumed from the ordinary dictionary  definition of
"unique") ?
<BR> In other words, if <TT><B>malloc(0)</B></TT> does not return a
null pointer,  is the following expression:
<BR>
<TT><B>malloc(0) == malloc(0)</B></TT>
<BR> always zero, always non-zero, or implementation-defined ?
<BR>
<B>Part 2</B>
<BR> If unique means "there is a single pointer," what is the result 
of attempting to free that pointer? How does the wording of 7.10.3 
apply:
<BR> The value of a pointer that refers to freed space is
indeterminate.
<BR> Possibly nothing happens, because the pointer does not really
point  to a block of memory. In that case, is the following code
strictly  conforming?
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdlib.h><BR> /*</B><I> .....</I> <B>*/<BR>
void *p = malloc(0);<BR>
if (p != NULL)<BR> {<BR> free (p); /*</B> <I>Line A</I> <B>*/<BR>free
(p); /*</B> <I>Line B</I><B> */<BR>}</B>
</TT><BR> What is the behavior if each of lines A and B are reached?
<BR>
<B>Part 3</B>
<BR> If "unique" means "different every time," then each  such call
still consumes address space, even though no storage actually  needs to
be allocated, and therefore the call can fail due to exhaustion  of
memory. Thus <TT><B>malloc(0)</B></TT> can return a null pointer,
while the  C Standard seems to suggest that an implementation can return
either  null pointers or unique pointers, but not both. This is a defect
in  the existing wording.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</B>
<BR> If "unique" means "there is a single pointer," then  change the
penultimate sentence of 7.10.3 from:
<BR> If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is 
implementation-defined; the value returned shall be either a null 
pointer or a unique pointer.
<BR> to:
<BR> If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is 
implementation-defined; the value returned shall be either a null 
pointer or a unique pointer. The values returned by two zero-length 
allocations shall compare equal. Freeing the value returned by a
zero-length  allocation shall have no effect. If that value is used as
an operand  of the unary <TT><B>*</B></TT> operator, or of a <TT><B>+</B></TT>
or <TT><B>-</B></TT> operator  except one whose other operand has
integral type and value zero, the  behavior is undefined.
<BR> If "unique" means "different every time," then change  it to:
<BR> If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is 
implementation-defined; either a null pointer is always returned,  or
the behavior is as if the size were some unspecified non-zero value.  In
the latter case, if the returned pointer is not a null pointer  and is
used as an operand of the unary <TT><B>*</B></TT> operator, or of a
<TT><B>+</B></TT>  or <TT><B>-</B></TT> operator except one whose
other operand has integral type  and value zero, the behavior is
undefined.

<BR> Technical Corrigendum
<BR> In subclause 7.10.3, change the next to last sentence to read:
<BR> If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is 
implementation defined: either a null pointer is returned, or the 
behavior is as if the size were some unspecified nonzero value, except 
that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object.<BR>
