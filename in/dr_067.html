Item 4 - definitions of types
<BR>
The terms ``signed integer type,'' ``unsigned integer type,'' 
and ``integral type'' are defined in subclause 6.1.2.5. The 
C Standard also uses the terms ``integer type,'' ``signed 
integral type,'' and ``unsigned integral type'' without defining 
them. Integer-valued bitfields are also introduced in subclause 6.5.2.
<BR><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> For each of the following types, which if any of the six categories 
above do they belong to?
<BR>
<TT><B>char<BR>
	signed char<BR>
	unsigned char<BR>
	signed short<BR>
	unsigned short<BR>
	signed int<BR>
	unsigned int<BR>
	signed long<BR>
	unsigned long<BR>
	int : N	 /*</B><I> i.e. bitfield of size N </I><B>/*<BR>
	signed int : N<BR>
	unsigned int : N<BR>
	enumerated type
</B></TT>
<LI> For each of these categories, do the <TT><B>const</B></TT> and/or <TT><B>volatile</B></TT> 
qualified versions of the types belonging to the category also belong 
to the category?
<LI> Can an implementation extension add other types defined by the 
C Standard to any of these six categories?
<LI> Can an implementation define other types (e.g. <TT><B>__very long</B></TT>) 
which belong to any of these six categories?
<LI> If the answer to (c) or (d), or both, is yes, can <TT><B>size_t</B></TT> 
and <TT><B>ptrdiff_t</B></TT> be one of these other types, or must it be a type 
in the above list?
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
a) ``Signed integer type'', ``unsigned integer type'', 
and plain ``integer type'' are used interchangeably with ``signed 
integral type'', ``unsigned integral type'', and ``integral 
type'' in the C Standard. This observation makes it easy to categorize 
the types in your list.
<BR>
b) Yes, see subclause 6.1.2.5.
<BR>
c) No, the list in the C Standard is meant to be exhaustive. For example, 
<TT><B>float</B></TT> cannot be defined as an integer type.
<BR>
d) No strictly conforming program could contain an instance of such 
a type. The treatment of such types is beyond the scope of the C Standard.
<BR>
e) No, it must be a type in the list. For example, <TT><B>size_t</B></TT> cannot 
be defined as <TT><B>unsigned __int24</B></TT>.
