    <p><b>Summary</b><br>
     7.19.6.1 (and similarly in 7.24.2.1):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl compact>
        <dt><tt><b>g,G</b></tt></dt>

        <dd>
          A <tt><b>double</b></tt> argument representing a
          floating-point number is converted in style
          <tt><b>f</b></tt> or <tt><b>e</b></tt> (or in style
          <tt><b>F</b></tt> or <tt><b>E</b></tt> in the case of a
          <tt><b>G</b></tt> conversion specifier), with the
          precision specifying the number of significant digits. If
          the precision is zero, it is taken as 1. The style used
          depends on the value converted; style <tt><b>e</b></tt>
          (or <tt><b>E</b></tt>) is used only if the exponent
          resulting from such a conversion is less than -4 or
          greater than or equal to the precision. Trailing zeros
          are removed from the fractional portion of the result
          unless the <tt><b>#</b></tt> flag is specified; a
          decimal-point character appears only if it is followed by
          a digit. 

          <p>A <tt><b>double</b></tt> argument representing an
          infinity or NaN is converted in the style of an
          <tt><b>f</b></tt> or <tt><b>F</b></tt> conversion
          specifier.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <p>Assuming "significant digits" is being used in the
    scientific-notation sense. This means that, for instance, the
    number "12.34" has four significant digits. So does "0.1234",
    and so does "0.001234". A value like "1.200" also has four
    significant digits, counting trailing zeros, but not leading
    zeros.</p>

    <p>Now, <tt><b>%g</b></tt> normally suppresses trailing zeros
    (as described above), so applying <tt><b>%.4g</b></tt> to the
    value 1.2 produces not "1.200" but rather just "1.2". The
    <tt><b>#</b></tt> modifier, however, stops the trailing-zero
    suppression, and:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <tt><b>printf("%#.4g\n", 1.2);</b></tt>
    </blockquote>
    must produce "1.200", four significant digits. 

    <p>The problem occurs when we go to print the value 0.0. No
    matter how many digits we tack on the end, we still have no
    significant digits. So what should:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <tt><b>printf("%#.4g\n", 0.0);</b></tt>
    </blockquote>
    print? "0.0000" has no significant digits. "0.0" has no
    significant digits. "0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    still has no significant digits. Which of these, if any, is
    correct output? Which of these is <em>desirable</em> output? 

    <p>The only way this wording makes any sense is if "significant
    digits" means something else entirely, but then what does it
    mean?</p>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Discussion</b> (for history only)</p>

    <p>There seemed to be some uncertainty about whether (for the
    <tt><b>%.4g</b></tt> example) the exponent would be
    <tt><b>0</b></tt> or <tt><b>1</b></tt>. This could yield
    different results.</p>

    <p>Some Committee members wondered whether the exponent would
    be <tt><b>1</b></tt> or <tt><b>0</b></tt> for ZERO. The bullet
    describing <tt><b>e, E</b></tt> is clear on this though "If the
    value is zero, the exponent is zero".</p>

    <p>If there is no implementation representation of ZERO, but
    rather a very small number. In this case, we generally thought
    that this was a user problem, that they could not rely on a
    true ZERO having a representation, in which case, they would
    need to place their own checks for what approximations were
    acceptable as ZERO and print a literal instead.</p>

    <p>Some pathological cases were checked, and appeared to work
    correctly.</p>

    <p>NOTE: In discussion, the original bullets were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>if X &lt; -4 or X &gt;= P, the conversion is with style e
      (or E) and precision P - 1</li>

      <li>otherwise the conversion is with style f (or F) and
      precision P - ( X + 1 )</li>
    </ul>
    But these were changed to: 

    <ul>
      <li>if P &gt; X &gt;= -4, the conversion is with style f (or
      F) and precision P - ( X + 1 )</li>

      <li>otherwise the conversion is with style e (or E) and
      precision P - 1</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During discussion, as it was considered to be the more pure
    form.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Technical Corrigendum</b><br>
    </p>

    <p>Change 7.19.6.1 paragraph 8 and 7.24.2.1 paragraph 8 to:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl compact>
        <dt><tt><b>g,G</b></tt></dt>

        <dd>
          A <tt><b>double</b></tt> argument representing a
          floating-point number is converted in style
          <tt><b>f</b></tt> or <tt><b>e</b></tt> (or in style
          <tt><b>F</b></tt> or <tt><b>E</b></tt> in the case of a
          <tt><b>G</b></tt> conversion specifier), depending on the
          value converted and the precision. Let <tt><b>P</b></tt>
          equal the precision if non-zero, 6 if the precision is
          omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero. Then, if a
          conversion with style <tt><b>E</b></tt> would have an
          exponent of <tt><b>X</b></tt>: 

          <ul>
            <li>if <tt><b>P &gt; X &gt;= -4</b></tt>, the
            conversion is with style <tt><b>f</b></tt> (or
            <tt><b>F</b></tt>) and precision <tt><b>P - (X +
            1)</b></tt>.</li>

            <li>otherwise the conversion is with style
            <tt><b>e</b></tt> (or <tt><b>E</b></tt>) and precision
            <tt><b>P - 1</b></tt>.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <blockquote>
        Finally, unless the <tt><b>#</b></tt> flag is used, any
        trailing zeroes are removed from the fractional portion of
        the result and the decimal-point character is removed if
        there is no fractional portion remaining.
