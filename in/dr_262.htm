     <b>Version:</b> 1.1<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2002-03-07<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> maximum size of bit fields.</p>
    <b>Problem</b> 

    <p>6.7.2.1#3 reads, in part:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#3] The expression that specifies the width of a
      bit-field shall be an integer constant expression that has
      nonnegative value that shall not exceed the number of bits in
      an object of the type that is specified if the colon and
      expression are omitted.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Is "the number of bits of the type ..." the width or is it
    the number of bits in the object representation ?</p>

    <p>Since it might not be practical to make use of padding bits
    in such an object, the former would be more sensible.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change the cited text to read:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [#3] The expression that specifies the width of a bit-field
      shall be an integer constant expression that has nonnegative
      value that shall not exceed <b>the width of an object</b> of
      the type that is specified if the colon and expression are
      omitted.

    <p><b>Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change 6.7.2.1#3 to read:</p>

    <blockquote>
      The expression that specifies the width of a bit-field shall
      be an integer constant expression that has nonnegative value
      that shall not exceed the width of an object of the type that
