     <b>Subject:</b> Semantics of <i>text-line</i> and
    <i>non-directive</i></p>

    <p><b>Summary</b><br>
     The semantics of <i>text-line</i> and <i>non-directive</i> are
    not specified in the C99 Standard.</p>

    <p><b>Question</b><br>
     Are <i>text-line</i> and <i>non-directive</i>
    implementation-defined ?</p>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>The standard is correct, but provide the following words
    with the response, and include them in the Rationale
    document:</p>

    <blockquote>
      Neither <i>text-line</i> nor <i>non-directive</i> is
      implementation defined. They are strictly defined as
      sequences of <i>pp-tokens</i> followed by <i>new-line</i>.
      Each of these rules represents a placeholder for an
      intermediate state in the phases of translation, and is
      expressed as a non-terminal since it has no associated
      semantics at this phase.<br>
      <br>
       However, these sequences of <i>pp-tokens</i> are still
      subject to normal processing in the subsequent phases of
      translation.
