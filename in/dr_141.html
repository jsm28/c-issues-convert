<H2>Defect Report #141</H2>
<B>Submission Date</B>: 10 Sep 94

<B>Question</B>
<BR>
What does <TT><B>EOF</B></TT> mean in <TT><B>&lt;stdio.h></B></TT>? Subclause 7.9.1 says 
that it ``is returned by several functions to indicate <I>end-of-file,</I> 
that is, no more input from a stream.''
<BR>
Taken at face value, the statement that there is no more input implies 
that further reads from the stream will yield <TT><B>EOF</B></TT>. In many implementations 
this is not true. It may be possible to read data from a stream on 
which the end-of-file indicator is set. Just whether that happens 
usually depends on what kind of file the stream is associated with. 
In System V, for example, one will almost always get more data on 
reading past <TT><B>EOF</B></TT> on a terminal, and almost never on a plain 
file. This violates the principle of device-independent behavior.
<BR>
I believe the System V behavior is wrong. Whenever <TT><B>feof</B></TT> would 
return nonzero, <TT><B>getc</B></TT> should return <TT><B>EOF</B></TT>.
<BR>
Some old code will break if <TT><B>EOF</B></TT> is made sticky as I suggest, 
but surprisingly little. When we made it sticky in v10 UNIX, we had 
to change exactly one dishonest program (sdb), which used ctl-D as 
if it were a character without putting the terminal in raw mode. Not 
one complaint arose from the change.
<BR>
On the other hand, almost every UNIX user has at one time or another 
been surprised by a nonsticky <TT><B>EOF</B></TT>, manifested as a program needing 
more than one <TT><B>EOT</B></TT> to stop it when <TT><B>stdin</B></TT> comes from a terminal. 
That breeds the habit of typing extra <TT><B>EOT</B></TT> at balky programs. 
The habit causes yet more trouble (hangup, for example), when things 
are merely slow and not really balky. This indefinite-<TT><B>EOF</B></TT> problem 
is not the fault of the programs, which should be able to count on 
a uniform behavior of <TT><B>EOF</B></TT> across all files. It is a fundamental 
mistake in the implementation of <TT><B>&lt;stdio.h></B></TT>.
<BR>
I urge the Committee to clarify <TT><B>EOF</B></TT>, and clarify it in the direction 
of predictability.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
It was certainly the intent of the Committee that end-of-file should 
indicate ``no more input from a stream,'' at least when returned 
by functions such as <TT><B>fgetc</B></TT>. In particular, subclause 7.9.7.1 
<B>The <TT>fgetc</TT> function</B> says, in part:
<BR>
If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for 
the stream is set and <TT><B>fgetc</B></TT> returns <TT><B>EOF</B></TT>.
``Setting the end-of-file indicator'' implies that
<I>that stream</I> is now considered to be ``at end-of-file.''
<BR>
For input from a stream
to return other than <TT><B>EOF</B></TT> after once returning 
<TT><B>EOF</B></TT> (with no intervening file-positioning operations
or calls to <TT><B>clearerr</B></TT>)
is non-conforming behavior, however widespread.
