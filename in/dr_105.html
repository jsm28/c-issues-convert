<B>Question</B>
<BR>
ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg12:
<BR>
Subclause 6.5 says (in its <B>Constraints</B> section):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All declarations in the same scope that refer to the same object 
or function shall specify compatible types.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
However in subclause 6.1.2.6 we have the following rule:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All declarations that refer to the same object or function shall 
have compatible type; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a conflict between the meaning of these two rules. The former 
rule indicates declaring something in two or more incompatible ways 
(in a given scope) <I>must</I> cause a diagnostic, while the latter 
rule indicates that doing the exact same thing may result in undefined 
behavior (i.e. possibly silent acceptance of the code by the implementation). 
(Note that this same issue was raised previously in the C Information 
Bulletin #1,<A HREF="dr_017.html#Question3"> RFI #17, question #3</A>.
 While the response to that question indicated that no change was needed, a 
change <I>is</I> clearly need in order to resolve this ambiguity.)
<BR>
Furthermore, the use of the term ``refer to'' in both of these 
rules seems both unnecessary and potentially confusing. Why not just 
talk instead about declarations ``declaring'' things, rather 
than ``referring to'' those things?
<BR>
To eliminate the first problem I would suggest that the rules quoted 
above from subclause 6.1.2.6 should be clarified as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If any pair of declarations of the same object or function which 
appear in different scopes declare the object or function in question 
to have two different incompatible types, the behavior is undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(Actually the rule regarding declaration compatability which now appears 
in subclause 6.1.2.6 seems entirely misplaced anyway. Shouldn't it 
just be taken out of subclause 6.1.2.6 and moved to the subclause 
on declarations, i.e. subclause 6.5?)
