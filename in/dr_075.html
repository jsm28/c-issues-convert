<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Item 12 - alignment of allocated memory
<BR>
Is a piece of memory allocated by <TT><B>malloc</B></TT> required to be aligned 
suitably for any type, or only for those types that will fit into 
the space? For example, following the assignment:
<BR>
<TT><B>void *vp = malloc (1);</B></TT>
<BR>
is it required that <TT><B>(void *)(int *)vp</B></TT> compare equal to <TT><B>vp</B></TT> 
(assuming that <TT><B>sizeof(int) > 1</B></TT>), or is it permissible for <TT><B>vp</B></TT> 
to be a value not suitably aligned to point to an <TT><B>int</B></TT>?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Subclause 7.10.3 requires allocated memory to be suitably aligned 
for <I>any</I> type, so they must compare equal.
