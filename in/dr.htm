<H2>WG14 Defect Report Summary</H2>
The list that follows provides a brief summary of all issues 
raised as separate questions within Defect Reports #001 through #178. 
Please note that the one-sentence summaries that follow seldom do 
justice to the issues, which are often subtle or complex. Read them 
to get a sense of the area of the C Standard requiring interpretation 
or correction. Be warned that they may well fail to properly characterize 
the precise concern.
