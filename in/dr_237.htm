     <b>Source:</b><br>
     <b>Reference Document:</b> N/A<br>
     <b>Version:</b> 1.2<br>

     <b>Subject:</b> Declarations using
    <tt><b>[static]</b></tt></p>

    <p><b>Summary</b> Given the following declarations:</p>
<pre>
<tt><b>  void f(int n, int x[static n]);
   void f(int n, int x[n]) {}
</b></tt> 
</pre>
    An example at the end of 6.7.5.3 (p21) indicates that these
    declarations are compatible, but it seems like there should
    also be something about this in composite types. 

    <ol>
      <li>If some declarations include "static" and some don't,
      what is the effect?</li>

      <li>Does <tt><b>static</b></tt> only count if it is on the
      definition?</li>

      <li>Does it count if it is on the declaration visible for a
      given call?</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Committee Discussion</b></p>

    <p>The Committee discussed adding a footnote to 6.7.5.3
    paragraph 7 along the lines of item 1.</p>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>The Committee believe the specification about composite
    types is clear enough; the composite type will be based on
    "qualified pointer to <i>type</i>", and the
    <tt><b>static</b></tt> keyword (and any size values) are not
    used.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The effect is as if all of the declarations had used
      <tt><b>static</b></tt> and the largest size value used by any
      of them. Each declaration imposes requirements on all calls
      to the function in the program; the only way to meet all of
      these requirements is to always provide pointers to as many
      objects as the largest such value requires.</li>

      <li>No.</li>

      <li>Yes. Visibility is not relevant.</li>
    </ol>
