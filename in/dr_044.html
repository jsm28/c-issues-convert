<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
Subclause 7.1.6, page 98, lines 24-30 describe the macro
<BR>
<TT>offsetof(<I><B>type, member_designator)</B></I></TT>
<BR>
``which expands to an integral constant expression that has type 
<TT><B>size_t</B></TT>, ...''
<BR>
How is this statement to be interpreted? The expansion of the macro 
<TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> is
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> an expression which can be evaluated during translation, the 
value of which is in the range representable by a <TT><B>size_t</B></TT> type.
<BR>
Or
<BR>
<LI> an expression as (a) above, but further constrained to be an 
``integral constant expression'' as defined in subclause 6.4, 
page 55, lines 17-21.
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Neither alternative (a) nor (b) in Question 1 fully captures the intent. 
What is intended is exactly what is specified in the C Standard. A 
strictly conforming program shall not produce output that varies depending 
upon details of implementation of facilities defined by the standard 
headers. Hence, use of the <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> macro, in a context requiring 
an integer constant expression, per se does not render a program not 
strictly conforming.
<BR>
Further clarification provided by David Prosser:
<BR>
Although the replacement for the <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> macro must be an integral 
constant expression, and must follow all the constraints appropriate 
to expressions, an implementation is permitted to make use of its 
extensions to constant expressions that behave like integral constant 
expressions. This is why the sample replacement expressions for the 
<TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> macro in the Rationale are valid candidates (for many 
implementations) but do not come under the strict definition of integral 
constant expression that strictly conforming code must follow. In 
particular, this is why the <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> macro exists: there was 
otherwise no portable means to compute such translation-time constants. 
Therefore, of the two choices, (b) is the closest, but it is not the 
whole story.
<BR>
<B>Question</B> 2
<BR>
Subclause 5.1.1.1, page 5, lines 11-20 define a ``translation unit'' 
to be equivalent to the sequence of preprocessing tokens and white-space 
characters which exists at the end of translation phase 4 (subclause 
5.1.1.2). Later in translation phases 5, 6, 7, these preprocessing 
tokens are converted to tokens and syntactically and semantically 
analyzed and translated.
<BR>
Therefore, must a conforming implementation provide strictly conforming 
expansions of macros defined by the standard headers, such that any 
use of the resulting preprocessing token sequence, and ultimately 
the token sequence, beyond phase 4 does not alter the behavior of 
an otherwise strictly conforming program? See also clause 4 <B>Compliance</B>, 
page 4, lines 24-26.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
A conforming implementation need not provide strictly conforming expansion 
of macros defined by the standard headers.
<BR>
<B>Question</B> 3
<BR>
Assuming (b) is the correct interpretation of Question 1, if a particular 
implementation expands <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> into an expression which contains 
operands and/or operators which result in a violation of the definition 
of ``integral constant expression'' from subclause 6.4, page 
55, lines 17-21, does this situation constitute:
<BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> a constraint violation since the expansion presented for further 
translation is not an ``integer constant expression?''
<BR>
or
<BR>
<LI> undefined behavior since the definition of ``integral constant 
expression'' appears in a ``shall'' requirement in the semantic 
description of subclause 6.4 <B>Constant expressions</B>?
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The response to Question 1 makes this a moot question.
<BR>
<B>Question</B> 4
<BR>
Assuming (b) is the correct interpretation of Question 3, if within 
a translation unit at a point where an ``integer constant expression'' 
is required to satisfy a language constraint - such as to specify 
the size of a bit-field member of a structure, the value of an enumeration 
constant, the size of an array, or the value of a case constant - 
does the use of the macro <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> constitute:
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> a constraint violation?
<BR>
or
<LI> the use of undefined behavior, which renders the translation 
unit to be not strictly conforming?
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The response to Question 1 makes this a moot question.
<BR>
<B>Question</B> 5
<BR>
Revisiting (b) as the correct interpretation of Question 1, it seems 
the only possibility for a definition of the macro <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> 
constitutes use of an identifier from the reserved name space to define 
a builtin which interrogates the translator's symbol table in a fashion 
analogous to the <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> operator. Further, this builtin must 
appear syntactically as a keyword rather than an identifier to avoid 
the constraint violation of subclause 6.4, page 55, line 9, which 
invalidates the use of what appears to be a function call within that 
which is otherwise required to be a constant expression.
<BR>
Further, implementing an expansion for <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> as described 
in the previous paragraph would violate the implementation constraint 
outlined in Question 2 above, since the expansion would inject preprocessing 
tokens requiring recognition of a keyword outside the scope of a strictly 
conforming program.
<BR>
In any case, the implication is that the fragment:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stddef.h><BR>
static struct x {int field1, field2; } s;<BR>
enum fields {F0, F1, F2 = offsetof(struct x,field2), F3 };
</B></TT><BR>
is either rendered not strictly conforming or the implementation is 
rendered a nonconforming implementation.
<BR>
Alternatively, if the answer to Question 2 above is no, then the following 
questions are raised:
<BR>
Since translation phases 1 through 4 may introduce into the translation 
unit token sequences which are not strictly conforming, what mechanism 
exists, if any, to determine whether such sequences originated from 
the program source?
<BR>
How is one to interpret the meaning of ``strictly conforming program'' 
from clause 4, page 3, lines 38-40, given that subclause 5.1.1.1, 
page 5, lines 12-15 define the translation unit to be ``a source 
file together with all the headers and source files included via the 
preprocessing directive <TT><B>#include</B></TT>, less any source lines skipped 
by any of the conditional inclusion preprocessing directives?''
<BR>
It seems that any program which makes use of the macro <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> 
in the context of a constraint requirement mandating an ``integer 
constant expression'' will require use of unspecified, undefined, 
or implementation-defined behavior.
<BR>
As near as I can tell, <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> is the only macro defined by 
the C Standard which can alter the behavior of a strictly conforming 
program as a consequence of its own definition.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The response to Question 1 addresses this issue.
