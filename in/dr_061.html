<B>Question</B>
<BR>
I am requesting an interpretation of white space in the format string 
of a scan statement. One of our customers is concerned about this 
as it appears to conflict with some books on C. I am referring to 
subclause 7.9.6.2, page 135, paragraph 3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A directive composed of white space character(s) is executed 
by reading input up to the first non-white-space character (which 
remains unread), or until no more characters can be read.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Page 135, paragraph 7 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the length of the input item is zero, the execution of the 
directive fails: this condition is a matching failure, unless an error 
prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
My questions are:
<BR><OL>
<LI> Is white space in the format string a directive which must be 
satisfied by white space in the input string?
<LI> What are the correct answers to the following examples? Note 
the white space in the format string.
</OL>
Example 1:
<BR>
<TT><B>inputString = "123ABCD";<BR>
numAssigned = sscanf(inputString, "%lu %ls", &amp;ulongVal, junkchar);
<BR></B></TT>
Should the result be <TT><B>numAssigned</B></TT> equal to 1?
<BR>
Example 2:
<BR>
<TT><B>inputString = "123ABCD";<BR>
numAssigned = sscanf(inputString, "%lu%ls", &amp;ulongVal, junkchar);
<BR></B></TT>
Should the result be <TT><B>numAssigned</B></TT> equal to 2?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
A directive composed of one or more white-space characters can successfully 
match zero white-space characters in the input stream. The paragraphs 
that intervene between your two quotations make clear that the second 
paragraph applies only to a directive that is a conversion specification.
<BR>
Thus, both examples should assign 2 to <TT><B>numAssigned</B></TT>.
