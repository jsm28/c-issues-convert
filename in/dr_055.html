<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
It has been suggested that the six macros <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT>, <TT><B>SIGFPE</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>SIGILL</B></TT>, <TT><B>SIGINT</B></TT>, <TT><B>SIGSEGV</B></TT>, and <TT><B>SIGTERM</B></TT> must 
have distinct values. Here is the relevant portion of subclause 7.7:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
``The macros defined are
<BR>
<TT><B>SIG_DFL<BR>
		SIG_ERR<BR>
		SIG_IGN<BR>
</TT></B>
which expand to constant expressions with distinct values that have 
type compatible with the second argument to and the return value of 
the <TT><B>signal</B></TT> function, and whose value compares unequal to the 
address of any declarable function; and the following, each of which 
expands to a positive integral constant expression that is the signal 
number corresponding to the specified condition:
<BR>
...
<BR>
An implementation need not generate any of these signals, except as 
a result of explicit calls to the <TT><B>raise</B></TT> function.''
</BLOCKQUOTE>
On the one hand, the reference to ``the signal number corresponding 
to the specified condition'' might be assumed to imply different 
numbers for each signal. On the other hand, the words ``distinct 
values'' were explicitly used for the three <TT><B>SIG_*</B></TT> macros 
and are conspicuously missing for the others.
<BR>
Also, I think it's worth noting that the standard expects <TT><B>raise</B></TT> 
to work meaningfully (i.e. to be able to tell them apart).
<BR>
Summary: must <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT>, <TT><B>SIGFPE</B></TT>, <TT><B>SIGILL</B></TT>, <TT><B>SIGINT</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>SIGSEGV</B></TT>, and <TT><B>SIGTERM</B></TT> have distinct values?

and the following, each of which expands to a positive integral constant 
expression that is the signal number corresponding to the specified 
condition:

and the following, which expand to positive integral constant expressions 
with distinct values that are the signal numbers, each corresponding 
to the specified condition:
