<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>

<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 009: Details of reserved symbols
<BR> The wording of subclause 7.13 is unclear.
<BR> Does the term <I>any combination</I> in subclause 7.13 include 
the empty combination? In other words, are names like <TT><B>E2</B></TT>,
<TT><B>tom</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>LC_X</B></TT>, and <TT><B>memo</B></TT> reserved?<BR>
<B>Response</B><BR>
Yes, the term "any combination" does include the empty combination
so names such as those cited are reserved.  We believe that having the 
"any combination" language in parenthetical remarks rather than as
part of the main text makes is sufficiently clear that it is just
the prefix that is important in determining whether a name is
reserved or not.
