<BR> Defect Report UK 015: Consistency of the C Standard
<BR> The change to the <TT><B>n</B></TT> conversion specifier in subclause 7.9.6.2  made by
 TC1, <A HREF="dr_014.html#Question14"> Defect Report #014, Question 2</A>, should also be applied  to subclause 7.9.6.1. Change:
<BR> No argument is converted.
<BR> to:
<BR> No argument is converted, but one is consumed.
<BR> If the conversion specification with this conversion specifier is 
not one of <TT><B>%n</B></TT>, <TT><B>%ln</B></TT>, or <TT><B>%hn</B></TT>,
the behavior is undefined.
<BR> In addition, an entry something like:
<BR> A <TT><B>%n</B></TT> conversion specification for the <TT><B>fprintf</B></TT>
or 
<TT><B>fscanf</B></TT> functions is not one of <TT><B>%n</B></TT>,
<TT><B>%ln</B></TT>, or <TT><B>%hn</B></TT>  (7.9.6.1, 7.9.6.2).
<BR> should be added to Annex G.2.
