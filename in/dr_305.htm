     <b>Version:</b> 1.1<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2006-03-05<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> 6.10.1p3: Clarifying handling of keywords in
    <code>#if</code> directives</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b></p>

    <p>This just clarifies that keywords are not treated specially
    in <code>#if</code> directives. (In C++, the keywords
    <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> <strong>are</strong>
    treated specially in this regard; I suspect that someone didn't
    want the sentence to read, "... all remaining identifiers,
    except for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, are
    replaced ...", for reasons which seem fairly obvious to
    me.)</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change the following sentence in 6.10.1p3:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>After all replacements due to macro expansion and the
      <code>defined</code> unary operator have been performed, all
      remaining identifiers <u>and keywords</u> are replaced with
      the pp-number <code>0</code>, and then each preprocessing
      token is converted into a token.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>It is clear from the standard (in particular, the phases of
    translation) that there are not yet any keywords at the point
    in question.</p>

    <p><b>Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change the following sentence in 6.10.1p3:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>After all replacements due to macro expansion and the
      <code>defined</code> unary operator have been performed, all
      remaining identifiers <u>(including those lexically identical
      to keywords)</u> are replaced with the pp-number
      <code>0</code>, and then each preprocessing token is
      converted into a token.</p>
