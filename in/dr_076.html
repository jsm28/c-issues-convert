Item 13 - pointers to the end of arrays
<BR>
Consider the following code extracts:
<BR>
<TT><B>int a [10];<BR>
	int *p;<BR>
	/*</B><I> ... </I><B>*/<BR>
	p = &amp;a[10];
</B></TT><BR>
and
<BR>
<TT><B>int *n = NULL;<BR>
	int *p<BR>
	/*</B><I> ... </I><B>*/<BR>
	p = &*n;
</B></TT><BR>
In the first extract, is the assignment strictly conforming (with 
<TT><B>p</B></TT> being set to the expression <TT><B>a + 10</B></TT>), or is the constraint 
in subclause 6.3.3.2 violated because <TT><B>a[10]</B></TT> is not an object? 
Note that this expression is often seen in the idiom:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>for (p = &amp;a[0]; p &amp;lt; &amp;a[10]; p++)<BR>
		/*</B><I> ... </I><B>*/
</B></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
In the second extract, is the assignment strictly conforming (with 
<TT><B>p</B></TT> being set to a null pointer), or is the constraint
in subclause 6.3.3.2 
violated because <TT><B>*n</B></TT> is not an object?
<BR>
If only one assignment is strictly conforming, what distinguishes 
the two cases? If either assignment is strictly conforming, what distinguishes 
it from the situation described in the following extract from the 
response to <A HREF="dr_012.html">Defect Report #012</A>?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given the following declaration:
<BR>
<TT><B>void *p;</B></TT>
<BR>
the expression <TT><B>&*p</B></TT> is invalid. This is because <TT><B>*p</B></TT> is of 
type <TT><B>void</B></TT> and so is not an lvalue, as discussed in the quote 
from subclause 6.2.2.1 above. Therefore, as discussed in the quote 
from subclause 6.3.3.2 above, the operand of the <TT><B>&</B></TT> operator 
in the expression <TT><B>&*p</B></TT> is invalid because it is neither a function 
designator nor an lvalue.
<BR>
This is a constraint violation
and the translator must issue a diagnostic message.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
This issue remains open. The C Standard as currently worded
has the following consequences:
<BR>
1) Subclause 6.3.3.2 requires the operand of <TT><B>&</B></TT>
to be an lvalue designating an object; <TT><B>a[10]</B></TT> is not an object.
<BR>
2) Subclause 6.3.3.2 requires the operand of <TT><B>&</B></TT>
to be an lvalue; <TT><B>NULL</B></TT> is not an lvalue.
<BR>
Since the use of either construct prevents a program from being strictly
conforming, the remaining portion of the question is not applicable.
<BR>
However, the Committee is not entirely comfortable with these
restrictions and may decide to relax them in resolving this issue.
