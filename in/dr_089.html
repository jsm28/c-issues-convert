Item 26 - multiple definitions of macros
<BR>
Consider the following code:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define macro	object_like<BR>
#define macro(argument)	function_like
</B></TT><BR>
Does this code require a diagnostic?
<BR>
The wording of subclause 6.8.3 specifies that a macro may be redefined 
under certain circumstances (basically identical definitions), but 
does not actually forbid any other redefinition. Thus it can be argued 
that the constraint in subclause 6.8.3 is not violated, and a diagnostic 
is not required.
