<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Suppose I run the following program in a US environment, where the 
clocks will jump forward from 01:59:59 to 03:00:00 on April 3, 1994. 
This program attempts to invoke <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> on a <TT><B>struct tm</B></TT> 
that represents 02:30:00 on that date. Does the C Standard let <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> 
return -1 in this case?
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdio.h><BR>
#include &lt;time.h><BR>
int main()<BR>
	{<BR>
	struct tm t;<BR>
	time_t r;<BR>
<BR>
	/*</B><I> 1994-04-03 02:30:00 </I><B>*/<BR>
	t.tm_year = 1994 - 1900; t.tm_mon = 3; t.tm_mday = 3;<BR>
	t.tm_hour = 2; t.tm_min = 30; t.tm_sec = 0;<BR>
<BR>
	t.tm_isdst = -1; /*</B><I> i.e. unknown </I><B>*/<BR>
<BR>
	r = mktime(&amp;t);<BR>
	if (r == -1)<BR>
		printf("mktime failed\n");<BR>
	else<BR>
		printf("%s", ctime(&amp;r));<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
The ANSI C Rationale (corresponding to subclause 7.12.2.3) clearly 
lets <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> yield -1 in the ``fall-backward fold'' 
that will occur when the clock is turned back from 01:59:59 to 01:00:00 
on October 30, 1994. The question is whether <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> is also 
allowed to yield -1 in the ``spring-forward gap'' when the 
clock is advanced from 01:59:59 to 03:00:00.
<BR>
This question arose when Arthur David Olson's popular ``tz'' 
time zone software was tested using NIST-PCTS:151-2, Version 1.4, 
(1993-12-03) a test suite put out by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology that attempts to test C and Posix conformance.  The 
PCTS package insists that in the above case, <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> must yield 
a <TT><B>time_t</B></TT> corresponding to either 01:30:00 or 03:30:00; i.e. 
PCTS rejects Olson's <TT><B>mktime</B></TT>, which yields -1.
<BR>
This test case differs in an important way from the common practical 
use of <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> to ``add 1'' to the output of <TT><B>localtime</B></TT> 
or <TT><B>gmtime</B></TT>, since those functions normally set <TT><B>tm_isdst</B></TT> 
to a nonnegative value, whereas <TT><B>tm_isdst</B></TT> is -1 in the case 
under question.
<BR>
I suggest that the Committee issue a clarification which makes it 
clear that <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> can yield -1 in the spring-forward gap 
when <TT><B>tm_isdst</B></TT> is -1.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The Standard does not specify the behavior precisely enough to preclude 
<TT><B>mktime</B></TT> from returning a value of <TT><B>(time_t)-1</B></TT> and leaving 
the <TT><B>tm_isdst</B></TT> member set to -1 in such situations.
