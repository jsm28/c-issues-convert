     <b>Subject:</b> <tt><b>struct tm</b></tt>, member
    <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt>, and <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt> in
    <tt><b>&lt;time.h&gt;</b></tt></p>

    <p><b>Summary</b></p>

    <p>If it is not known whether daylight saving time is in effect
    (<tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt> set to <tt><b>-1</b></tt>), some
    times expressed in <tt><b>struct tm</b></tt> become ambiguous.
    There is no specification as to what <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt>
    should do for such cases.</p>

    <p><b>Questions</b></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Normally when calling <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt>, the user
      will set <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt> to <tt><b>-1</b></tt> to
      request that <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt> determine the true
      value (See 7.23.2.3 footnote 267). Usually,
      <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt> can determine whether daylight
      saving time is in effect based on the time and date
      information initially stored in the <tt><b>struct tm</b></tt>
      argument. However, during the Fall change over, there is one
      hour that exists both in daylight saving time and standard
      time. Example: In France, we will change time on October the
      27th at 3am. That means that at 3am it will be 2am again. If
      asked to convert October 27 at 2.30am when
      <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt> is <tt><b>-1</b></tt>, what value
      should <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt> store in
      <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt> and what is the return value?</li>

      <li>For the same example as point <tt><b>1</b></tt>, what
      should we return in case <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt> is set to
      <tt><b>0</b></tt> or <tt><b>1</b></tt> ?</li>

      <li>In a general case, what should we do in case
      <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt> is different from <tt><b>-1</b></tt>
      ?</li>

      <li>When calling <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt> function, is it
      true that this function should modify the <tt><b>tm</b></tt>
      structure to put in it the GM time instead the local time
      given as an entry ?</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Suggested Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>Subclause 7.23.1 Paragraph 1 of the C Standard says,</p>

    <blockquote>
      "The local time zone and Daylight Saving Time are
      implementation-defined."
    </blockquote>
    That means that the standard does not specify the behavior and
    that the implementation is free to make choices that it must
    document. Although the C Standard imposes no particular
    definition on daylight saving time, other standards or local
    custom may. 

    <ol>
      <li>It is implementation defined. For example, an
      implementation might assume that daylight saving time is not
      in effect and set <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt> to
      <tt><b>0</b></tt> and return the <tt><b>time_t</b></tt> value
      corresponding to 2:30 AM Standard Time.</li>

      <li>It is implementation defined. However, assuming that an
      implementation chose a conventional definition of daylight
      saving time, these times are unambiguous since the user
      specified whether daylight saving time was in effect, and the
      <tt><b>time_t</b></tt> return value would be different for
      2:30 daylight saving time versus 2:30 standard time. Note
      that it would be reasonable for <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt> to
      change <tt><b>tm_hour</b></tt> and <tt><b>tm_isdst</b></tt>
      on output. For example, <tt><b>tm_hour=2</b></tt> and
      <tt><b>tm_isdst=1</b></tt> on input might change to
      <tt><b>tm_hour=1</b></tt> and <tt><b>tm_dst=0</b></tt> on
      output.</li>

      <li>It is implementation defined. One possibility would be to
      consider any two <tt><b>struct tm</b></tt> values as being
      exactly one hour apart if all members have the same value
      except that one <tt><b>struct tm</b></tt> value has
      <tt><b>tm_isdst=1</b></tt> and the other has
      <tt><b>tm_isdst=0</b></tt> (regardless of the date stored in
      the <tt><b>struct tm</b></tt> values).</li>

      <li>No. A <tt><b>struct tm</b></tt> represents a local time
      in the local time zone for <tt><b>mktime()</b></tt>. See
      7.23.2.3 Paragraph 2.</li>
    </ol>
