<I>Submitted to BSI by Clive D.W. Feather  clive@sco.com .</I>
<BR>
<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 017: Trigraphs
<BR> The C Standard's description of the replacement of trigraphs is
contradictory.
<BR> Subclause 5.2.1.1 reads in part:
<BR> All occurrences in a source file of the following sequences  of
three characters (called trigraph sequences [7]) are replaced with  the
corresponding single character... Each <TT><B>?</B></TT> that does not
begin  one of the trigraphs listed above is not changed.
<BR> Since the second character in each trigraph is a <TT><B>?</B></TT>
that does  not begin the trigraph, this is a direct contradiction.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR> Change the last sentence of the cited text to:
<BR> Each <TT><B>?</B></TT> that is not part of one of the trigraphs
listed  above is not changed.
<BR> Proposed Response
<BR> The C Standard is clear enough as is. A trigraph begins with two
question  marks, so it is reasonable to refer to both of them as
beginning the  trigraph.
