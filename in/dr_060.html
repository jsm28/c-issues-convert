<B>Question</B>
<BR>
When an array of <TT><B>char</B></TT> (or <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT>) is initialized with 
a string literal that contains fewer characters than the array, are 
the remaining elements of the array initialized?
<BR>
Subclause 6.5.7 <B>Initialization</B>, page 72, only says (emphasis 
mine):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If there are fewer initializers in a <I>brace-enclosed list</I> 
than there are members of an aggregate, the remainder of the aggregate 
shall be initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static 
storage duration.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>In subclause 6.5.7, page 72, the penultimate paragraph of Semantics 
(before Examples), add after the comma:</B></I>
<BR>
or fewer characters in a string literal or wide string literal used 
to initialize an array of known size, and elements of character or 
<TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> type
