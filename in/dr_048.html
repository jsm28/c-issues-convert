<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
This Defect Report requests a clarification regarding the valid interpretations 
of the <TT><B>abort</B></TT> function, especially when the implementation must 
also match the requirements of POSIX.1 (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990).
<BR>
The C Standard states (subclause 7.10.4.1, page 155):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><B>abort</B></TT> function causes abnormal termination to occur, 
unless the signal <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> is being caught and the signal handler 
does not return. Whether open output streams are flushed or open streams 
closed or temporary files removed is implementation-dependent. An 
implementation-defined form of the status <I>unsuccessful termination</I> 
is returned to the host environment by means of the function call 
<TT><B>raise(SIGABRT)</B></TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and (subclause 7.10.4.3, page 156):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><B>exit</B></TT> function causes normal program termination to 
occur.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and (subclause 7.10.4.1, page 101 [Rationale]):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Committee vacillated over whether a call to <TT><B>abort</B></TT> 
should return if the signal <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> is caught or ignored. To 
minimize astonishment, the final decision was that <TT><B>abort</B></TT> never 
returns.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The POSIX.1 Standard states (subclause 3.2, page 46):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are two kinds of process termination:
<BR>
(1) Normal termination occurs by a return from <TT><B>main()</B></TT> 
or when requested with the <TT><B>exit()</B></TT> or <TT><B>_exit()</B></TT> functions.
<BR>
(2) Abnormal termination occurs when requested by the <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> 
function or when some signals are received (see 3.3.1).
<BR>
The <TT><B>exit()</B></TT> and <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> functions shall be as described 
in the C Standard {2}. Both <TT><B>exit()</B></TT> and <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> shall terminate 
a process with the consequences specified in 3.2.2, except that the 
status made available to <TT><B>wait()</B></TT> or <TT><B>waitpid()</B></TT> by <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> 
shall be that of a process terminated by the <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> signal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and (subclause 8.2.3.12, page 161):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><B>exit()</B></TT> function shall have the effect of <TT><B>fclose()</B></TT> 
... as described above. The <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> function shall also have 
these effects if the call to <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> causes process termination, 
but shall have no effect on streams otherwise. The C Standard {2} 
specifies the conditions where <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> does or does not cause 
process termination. For the purposes of that specification, a signal 
that is blocked shall not be considered caught.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and (subclause B.8.2.3.12, page 291 [Rationale]):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
POSIX.1 intends that processing related to the <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> 
function will occur unless ``the signal <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> is being 
caught, and the signal handler does not return,'' as defined by 
the C Standard {2}. This processing includes at least the effect of 
<TT><B>fclose()</B></TT> on all open streams, and the default actions defined 
for <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT>.
<BR>
The <TT><B>abort()</B></TT> function will override blocking or ignoring 
the <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> signal. Catching the signal is intended to provide 
the application writer with a portable means to abort processing, 
free from possible interference from any implementation-provided library 
functions.
<BR>
Note that the term ``program termination'' in the C Standard 
{2} is equivalent to ``process termination'' in POSIX.1.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The above quotes make it clear that the POSIX.1 Standard intends to 
have the abort function implementation be roughly the following:
<BR><OL>
<LI> Inquire about <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> handling.
<LI> If currently blocked, unblock <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT>.
<LI> If currently <TT><B>SIG_IGN</B></TT>, reset <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> to <TT><B>SIG_DFL</B></TT>.
<LI> If currently <TT><B>SIG_DFL</B></TT>, flush all open output streams.
<LI> <TT><B>raise(SIGABRT)</B></TT>.
<LI> Reset <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> to <TT><B>SIG_DFL</B></TT> (handler must have returned).
<LI> Go to step 5.
</OL>
As far as the C Standard is concerned, step 2 is outside its scope, 
so it can be part of a valid implementation. (The effects cannot be 
noticed by a strictly conforming program.) Step 4 is clearly permitted 
as well. It is step 3 and the loop that are the key of this Defect 
Report. (Note that step 3 could have been skipped above as it would 
be handled by the 5-6-7 loop, but I've left it explicit for clarity.)
<BR>
The special case in the C Standard regarding <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> handlers 
that don't return is intended to keep the implementation straightforward. 
(It is, in general, difficult to determine whether a handler will 
return without calling it!) The POSIX.1 Standard has understood the 
C Standard to require, in effect, an implementation to force an uncaught 
<TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> to terminate the program. But, is this actually the 
C Standard's intent? The Rationale quote can certainly be taken to 
indicate that catching and ignoring <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> are in the same 
category.
<BR>
Does the C Standard either permit or require an implementation to 
reset an ignored <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> to <TT><B>SIG_DFL</B></TT>? Or, does the C Standard 
permit or require a call similar to <TT><B>exit(EXIT_FAILURE)</B></TT>? Is the 
distinction between abnormal termination and unsuccessful normal termination 
beyond the scope of the C Standard? (After all, how can it be tested?) 
And, finally, can a portable application find any utility in setting 
<TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> to <TT><B>SIG_IGN</B></TT>?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Does the C Standard either permit or require an implementation to 
reset an ignored <TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> to <TT><B>SIG_DFL</B></TT>?
<BR>
Answer: Yes, it permits it. There is no way to detect such a change 
in a strictly conforming program.
<BR>
Or, does the C Standard permit or require a call similar to <TT><B>exit(EXIT_FAILURE)</B></TT>?
<BR>
Answer: No. Abnormal termination does not allow calls to the <TT><B>atexit</B></TT>-registered 
functions.
<BR>
Does the C Standard? (After all, how can it be tested?)
<BR>
Answer: No. See above.
<BR>
And, finally, can a portable application find any utility in setting 
<TT><B>SIGABRT</B></TT> to <TT><B>SIG_IGN</B></TT>?
<BR>
Answer: Not within the context of <TT><B>abort</B></TT>.
<BR>
We note that therefore there is no clash between Standard C and POSIX.1.
