     <b>Source:</b><br>
     <b>Reference Document:</b> N/A<br>
     <b>Version:</b> 1.3<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2001-09-18 15:46:36<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> <tt><b>atexit</b></tt> function
    registration</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b><br>
     7.20.4.2 reads:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [#3] The implementation shall support the registration of at
      least 32 functions.
    </blockquote>
    This does not require registration of a valid function to
    succeed. The implementation could fail the first 420 times
    <tt><b>atexit()</b></tt> is called, and then succeed 32 times.
    It also does not require <tt><b>atexit()</b></tt> to accept any
    function of the correct type; theoretically an implementation
    could reject (say) a function in a different translation unit. 

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b><br>
     Change the cited wording to:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [#3] The implementation shall not reject the registration of
      a valid function if less than 32 functions are already
      registered (multiple registrations of the same function
      counting multiple times).
    </blockquote>
    or add the following words: 

    <blockquote>
      If less than this number are already registered, a call with
      a valid argument shall succeed.
    </blockquote>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b><br>
     There are many conditions under which any library function or
    language feature may fail or behave in an undefined manner.
    Some examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All of memory has been allocated</li>

      <li>The stack has overflowed</li>
    </ul>
    As such, it is a quality of implementation issue under what
    conditions any library function, including
    <tt><b>atexit()</b></tt>, may fail. 

    <p>There is no consensus to make the suggested change or any
    change along this line.</p>
