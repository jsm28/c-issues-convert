  WG14 N1223</a><br>
  <b>Version:</b> 1.4<br>
  <b>Date:</b> 2008-09-10<br>
  <b>Subject:</b> VLAs and conditional expressions</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>

  <p>Consider the code:</p>
  <pre>
    int a, b;
    void *p1(void), *p2(void);
    int c1(void);
    int d1(void);
    int z1(void), z2(void);

    int
    h(void)
    {
      int r = (c1()
               ? (z1(), (int (*)[d1()])p1())
               : (z2(), (int (*)[])p2()))[a][b];
      return r;
    }
</pre>

  <p>The type of the conditional expression involves the size
  expression <code>d1()</code> that's only evaluated in one part of
  the expression, and this information is needed to evaluate the
  array reference even when <code>c1()</code> returns false.</p>

  <p>For a more complicated example and discussion see reflector
  messages 10731-10754. The validity of that more complicated
  example depends on the interpretation of composite type rules as
  in <a href="dr_340.htm">DR 340</a>, so this example has been
  simplified to avoid that problem.</p>

  <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b><br>
  6.7.5.2 paragraph 6 at end add "or one of the size specifiers
  (including the case of a single size specifier where the other
  array type does not include a size specifier) is not an integer
  constant expression and is not evaluated during the flow of
  execution." with a footnote "This case arises where a conditional
  expression involves a cast to variably modified type or a
  compound literal of variably modified type."</p>

  <p><b>Committee Discussion</b> (for history only)</p>

  <h4>Spring 2008</h4>

  <p>The consensus is that the <i>Note</i> in the previous version
  of this DR was not accurate and should be removed. The DR should
  be in Review status</p>

  <h4>Fall 2008</h4>

  <p>The consensus at this meeting is that this defect should be
  linked with defect report 340.</p>

  <p><b>Proposed Committee Response</b></p>
