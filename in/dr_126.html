ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg33:
<BR>
Subject: What does ``synonym'' mean with respect to typedef 
names?
<BR>
Given the declarations:
<BR>
<TT><B>typedef int *IP;<BR>
const IP object;
</B></TT><BR>
what is the type of <TT><B>object</B></TT>?
<BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.5.6 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A <TT><B>typedef</B></TT> declaration does not introduce a new type, 
only a synonym for the type so specified.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
At least one person has wondered aloud about the true meaning of this 
rule.
<BR>
Note that if the name <TT><B>IP</B></TT> in the above example is expanded as 
if it were a mere macro, then the type of <TT><B>object</B></TT> would be <TT><B>(const 
int *)</B></TT>. But essentially all existing implementations act as if 
there were some sort of magical parsing precedence (or extra parenthesization) 
which causes the <TT><B>IP</B></TT> (when used in the second line of the example 
above) to be treated as a single type, to which the <TT><B>const</B></TT> qualifier 
is applied (after the fact) thus resulting in <TT><B>object</B></TT> having 
type <TT><B>(int * const)</B></TT> rather than <TT><B>(const int *)</B></TT>.
<BR>
While this treatment is well known to experienced implementors and 
users, it appears that the C Standard doesn't really explain it very 
well (or very precisely). I consider this to be a defect in the C 
Standard, worthy of the Committee's attention.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
A <TT><B>typedef</B></TT> introduces a name for a type. This is not a macro,
and the type must indeed be ``magically parenthesized.'' In
<BR>
<TT><B>
typedef int *ip;<BR>
ip x;<BR>
const ip y;
</B></TT><BR>
the type of <TT><B>x</B></TT> is <I>pointer to</I> <TT><B>int</B></TT>,
and the type of <TT><B>y</B></TT> is <TT><B>const</B></TT>
<I>pointer to</I> <TT><B>int</B></TT>. This is exactly
analogous to the fact that
<BR>
<TT><B>
ip x1, x2;
</B></TT><BR>
declares both <TT><B>x1</B></TT> and <TT><B>x2</B></TT>
as having the type <I>pointer to</I> <TT><B>int</B></TT>,
and is not to be read as
<BR>
<TT><B>
int *x1, x2;
</B></TT><BR>
