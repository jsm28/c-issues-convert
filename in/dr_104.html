ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg11:
<BR>
According to subclause 6.5:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If an identifier for an object is declared with no linkage, 
the type for the object shall be complete by the end of its declarator, 
or by the end of its init-declarator if it has an initializer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It would appear that the above rule effectly renders the following 
code not strictly conforming (because this code violates 
the above rule):
<BR>
<TT><B>typedef struct incomplete_S ST;<BR>
typedef union  incomplete_U UT;<BR>
<BR>
void example1(ST arg);	/*</B><I> diagnostic permitted/encouraged? </I><B>*/<BR>
void example2(UT arg);	/*</B><I> diagnostic permitted/encouraged? </I><B>*/
</B></TT><BR>
I have noted however that many/most/all ``conforming'' implementations 
do in fact accept code such as that shown above (without producing 
any diagnostics).
<BR>
Is it the intention of the Committee that code such as that shown 
above should be considered to be strictly conforming? If 
so, then some change to the wording now present in subclause 6.5 is 
in order (to allow for such cases).
