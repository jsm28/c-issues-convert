     <b>Submission Date:</b> 2000-04-04<br>
     <b>Source:</b><br>
     <b>Reference Document:</b> N/A<br>
     <b>Version:</b> 1.3<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2001-09-18 15:51:36<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> <tt><b>asctime</b></tt> limits</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b><br>
     The definition of the <tt><b>asctime</b></tt> function
    involves a <tt><b>sprintf</b></tt> call writing into a buffer
    of size 26. This call will have undefined behaviour if the year
    being represented falls outside the range [-999, 9999]. Since
    applications may have relied on the size of 26, this should not
    be corrected by allowing the implementation to generate a
    longer string. This is a defect because the specification is
    not self-consistent and does not restrict the domain of the
    argument.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b><br>
     Append to 7.23.3.1[#2]:</p>

    <blockquote>
      except that if the value of
      <tt><b>timeptr-&gt;tm_year</b></tt> is outside the range
      [-2899, 8099] (and thus the represented year will not fit
      into four characters) it is replaced by up to 4
      implementation-defined characters.
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b><br>
     From 7.1.4 paragraph 1:</p>

    <blockquote>
      If an argument to a function has an invalid value (such as a
      value outside the domain of the function, or a pointer
      outside the address space of the program, or a null pointer,
      or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the corresponding
      parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after promotion)
      not expected by a function with variable number of arguments,
      the behavior is undefined.
    </blockquote>
    Thus, <tt><b>asctime()</b></tt> may exhibit undefined behavior
    if any of the members of <tt><b>timeptr</b></tt> produce
    undefined behavior in the sample algorithm (for example, if the
    <tt><b>timeptr-&gt;tm_wday</b></tt> is outside the range 0 to 6
    the function may index beyond the end of an array). 

    <p>As always, the range of undefined behavior permitted
    includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Corrupting memory</li>

      <li>Aborting the program</li>

      <li>Range checking the argument and returning a failure
      indicator (e.g., a null pointer)</li>

      <li>Returning truncated results within the traditional 26
      byte buffer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is no consensus to make the suggested change or any
    change along this line.</p>
