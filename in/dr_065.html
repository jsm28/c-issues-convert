<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Item 2 - locales
<BR>
Consider the program:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdio.h><BR>
#include &lt;stdlib.h><BR>
#include &lt;locale.h><BR>
<BR>
int main (void)<BR>
	{<BR>
	int i;<BR>
	char *loc [] = { "English", "En_UK", "Loglan", "" };<BR>
<BR>
	for (i = 0; ; i++)<BR>
		if (setlocale (LC_ALL, loc [i]) != NULL)<BR>
			{<BR>
			/*</B><I><BR>
			 *  We must eventually get here,<BR>
			 *  because setlocale("") can't yield NULL.<BR>
			 </I><B>/*<BR>
			printf ("Decimal point = '%s'\n",<BR>
			localeconv ()->decimal_point);<BR>
			exit (0);<BR>
			}<BR>
	}
<BR></B></TT>
The valid locales are implementation-defined (subclause 7.4.1.1). 
Nevertheless, the output produced depends only on the locale, not 
any other implementation-defined behavior. Is the program strictly 
conforming?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The Committee affirms that the intent of this wording is that a program 
such as that above, whose output varies only according to the locale 
selected and does not rely on the presence of a specific locale other 
than the <TT><B>"C"</B></TT> locale or that selected by <TT><B>""</B></TT>, was always 
intended to be strictly conforming. Nevertheless, it is agreed that 
the cited extract from subclause 7.4.1.1 could be read strictly as 
making such programs depend on implementation-defined behavior.
<BR>
The Committee reaffirms that programs that depend on the identity 
of the available locales, as opposed to their contents, are not strictly 
conforming.
<BR>
The Committee believes that the first occurrence of the term ``implementation 
defined'' in subclause 7.4.1.1 was intended in the sense of ``implementation-documented.'' 
However, the Committee is reluctant to introduce a new term, with 
possibly new conformance requirements, in a Technical Corrigendum. 
The Committee notes that the term ``locale-specific,'' while 
making the sentence read somewhat awkwardly, carries the necessary 
requirements (the implementation must document the relevant details).
<BR>
The Committee decided that, though the question only addresses one 
issue to do with locales, the above discussion applies to all instances 
where the behavior of an implementation depends on the locale.  For 
this reason, the Committee decided to address all such issues at this 
time.
<BR>
The Committee should revisit this issue during the revision of the 
C Standard.

<I><B>In subclause 5.2.1.2, page 11, change the third bullet item:</B></I>

not in the <TT><B>"C"</B></TT> locale are noted below.
<BR>
The term <I>printing character</I> refers to a member of an implementation-defined 
set of characters, each of which occupies one printing position on 
a display device; the term <I>control character</I> refers to a member 
of an implementation-defined set of characters that are not printing 
characters.

and 7.10.1.6, page 152, change:</B></I>
<BR>

subject sequence forms may be accepted.
<BR>
<I><B>to:</B></I>
<BR>
In other than the <TT><B>"C"</B></TT> locale, additional locale-specific subject 
sequence forms may be accepted.
<BR>
<I><B>Change Footnote 131, page 159, from:</B></I>
<BR>
If the implementation employs special bytes to change the shift state, 
these bytes do not produce separate wide character codes, but are 
grouped with an adjacent multibyte character.
<BR>
<I><B>to:</B></I>
<BR>
If the locale employs special bytes to change the shift state, these 
bytes do not produce separate wide character codes, but are grouped 
with an adjacent multibyte character.
