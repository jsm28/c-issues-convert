<BR>
<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 025: Preprocessing directives
<BR> Preprocessing directives are not removed from the translation unit
 at any point during or after translation phase 4, and thus wreck the 
syntax analysis in translation phase 7.
<BR> Subclause 5.1.1.1 reads in part:
<BR> A source file together with all the headers and source files 
included via the preprocessing directive <TT><B>#include</B></TT>,
less any  source lines skipped by any of the conditional inclusion
preprocessing  directives, is called a <I>translation unit.</I>
<BR> Nothing here, in the description of translation phase 4, or in
subclause  6.8, states that any preprocessing directive is removed
(except for 
<TT><B>#include</B></TT>, which is <I>replaced</I>).
<BR> Consider the source file:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define QUIT return 0<BR> #if 0<BR> This is some junk<BR> #else<BR>
 int main (void)<BR> {<BR>         puts ("Hello world\n");<BR> #endif<BR>
         QUIT;<BR> }</B>
</TT><BR> The translation unit resulting at the end of translation
phase 4 is  thus:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define QUIT return 0<BR> #if 0<BR> #else<BR> int main (void)<BR>
 {<BR>         puts ("Hello world\n");<BR> #endif<BR>         return
0;<BR> }</B>
</TT><BR> and this clearly does not match the syntax of <I>translation-unit</I>
 in subclause 6.7.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR> In subclause 5.1.1.2, add at the end of the description of
translation  phase 4: All preprocessing directives are then removed from
the translation  unit.<BR><BR><A HREF="dr_176.html">Previous Defect Report</A>
