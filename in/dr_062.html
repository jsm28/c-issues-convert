<B>Question</B>
<BR>
If the only way to effectuate the renaming of a file on a given system 
is to copy the contents of the file, does an implementation conform 
to the C Standard by always returning a failure from the <TT><B>rename</B></TT> 
function? Footnote 113 would seem to imply this.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Yes, subclause 7.9.4.2 permits the <TT><B>rename</B></TT> function to fail if 
it must copy the file contents, among other reasons.
