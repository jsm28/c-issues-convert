<b>Question</b>
<br>
ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg24:
<br>
Subject: Abstract semantics, sequence points, and expression evaluation.
<br>
Does the following code involve usage which renders the 
code itself not strictly conforming?
<br>
<tt><b>int example ()<br>
	{<br>
	int x1 = 2, x2 = 1, x_temp;<br>
<br>
	return (x_temp = x1, x_temp) + (x_temp = x2, x_temp);<br>
	}
</b></tt><br>
Background:
<br>
Subclause 5.1.2.3:
<blockquote>
The semantic descriptions in this International Standard describe 
the behavior of an abstract machine in which issues of optimization 
are irrelevant.
</blockquote>
Subclause 6.3:
<blockquote>
Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall 
have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an 
expression.
</blockquote>
Although it is quite clear that the above quoted ``modified at 
most once'' rule was intended to render certain programs ``not 
strictly conforming,'' there is an unfortunate amount of ambiguity 
built into the current wording of that rule.
<br>
Quite simply, while the ``modified at most once'' rule is obviously 
telling us what a ``strictly conforming program'' must not do 
between two particular points <i>in time,</i> it is altogether less 
than clear what events and/or actions (exactly) are associated with 
these two points in time. Additionally, it is also less than clear 
(from reading the remainder of the C Standard) what actions and/or 
events are allowed (or required) to take place between some pair of 
sequence points in cases where both members of the pair are part of 
some large single expression whose evaluation order is not completely 
dictated by the C Standard.
<br>
Note that despite the assertion given in subclause 5.1.2.3 (and quoted 
above) the C Standard does not <i>fully</i> specify the behavior of 
the ``abstract machine,'' especially when it comes to the issue 
of the ordering of sub-expression evaluation used by the ``abstract 
machine'' model.
<br>
This fact makes it inherently impossible to precisely determine even 
just the <i>relative</i> timings of various events (including the 
``occurrence'' of or the ``execution'' of or the ``evaluation'' 
of sequence points) which may (or must) occur sometime during the 
evaluation of a larger containing expression (except in a few cases 
involving <tt><b>||</b></tt> or <tt><b>&amp;&amp;</b></tt> or <tt><b>?:</b></tt> or <tt><b>,</b></tt> operators).
<br>
To put it more plainly, if some pair of sequence points will be ``reached'' 
(or ``evaluated'' or ``executed'') during the evaluation 
of any pair of subexpressions which are themselves operands for some 
binary operator (other than the operators <tt><b>||</b></tt> or <tt><b>&amp;&amp;</b></tt> or 
<tt><b>?:</b></tt> or <tt><b>,</b></tt>) then the C Standard's description of the ``abstract 
machine'' semantics are inadequate to enable us to know either 
which <i>order</i> these two sequence points will occur in, or even 
which other aspects of the evaluation of the overall expression may 
(or must) occur ``between'' the two sequence points.
<br>
Thus, it seems that it may also be inherently impossible to know 
whether or not the prohibition against multiple modifications of a 
given variable ``between'' two consecutive sequence points is 
(or may be) violated in such contexts.
<br>
Here is a simple example of an expression which illustrates these 
points:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>	(x = i, x) + (x = j, x)</b></tt>
</blockquote>
In this expression there are two ``comma'' sequence points;
however, nothing in the C Standard gives any indication as to which 
of these two may be (or must be) ``evaluated'' or ``reached'' 
first. (Indeed, it would seem that on a parallel machine of some sort, 
<i>both</i> points could perhaps be reached simultaneously.)  It is 
fairly clear however that each of the references to the stored values 
of <tt><b>x</b></tt> must not be evaluated until their respective preceeding 
``comma sequence points'' have been ``reached'' or ``evaluated.'' 
Thus, a partial (but very incomplete) ordering is imposed upon the 
sequence of events which must occur during the evaluation of this 
expression.
<br>
For the sake of this example, let us call the leftmost comma in the 
above expression ``lcomma'' and call the rightmost comma ``rcomma.'' 
Given this terminology, it would appear that the C Standard permits 
the following sequence of events during evaluation of the above expression:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>	eval(i)<br>
	x=          (leftmost assignment to x)<br>
	lcomma      &lt;==== sequence point<br>
	eval(x)     (leftmost reference to stored value of x)<br>
	eval(j)<br>
	x=          (rightmost assignment to x)<br>
	rcomma      &lt;==== sequence point<br>
	eval(x)     (rightmost reference to stored value of x)<br>
	+
</b></tt></blockquote>
Note that in this (very realistic) example, the stored value of <tt><b>x</b></tt> 
is <i>never</i> modified more than once between any pair of sequence 
points. Given that the ordering described above is both a perfectly 
<i>plausible</i> and also a perfectly <i>permissible</i> ordering 
for the evaluation of the expression in question, and given that this 
particular permissible ordering of events does not violate the ``modified 
at most once'' rule (quoted earlier) it therefore appears that 
the expression in question may in fact be interpreted as being ``strictly 
conforming,'' and that such expressions may appear within ``strictly 
conforming'' programs.
<br>
I would like the Committee to either confirm or reject this view, 
and to provide some commentary explaining that confirmation or rejection.
<br>
<b>Response</b>
<br>
The C Standard does not forbid an implementation from interleaving
the subexpressions in the given example as specified above. Similarly,
there is no requirement that an implementation use this particular
interleaving. It is irrelevant that one particular interleaving
yields code that properly delimits multiple modifications of the
same object with sequence points. Any program that depends on this
particular interleaving is depending on unspecified behavior, and is
therefore not strictly conforming.
