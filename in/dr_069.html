Item 6 - representation of integral types
<BR>
Subclause 6.1.2.5 refers to the representation of a value in an integral
type being in a ``pure binary numeration system,'' and defines
this further in Footnote 18. On the other hand, the wording of ISO
2382 is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
05.03.15<BR>
<B>binary (numeration) system</B><BR>
The <I>fixed radix numeration system</I> that uses the <I>bits</I>
0 and 1 and the <I>radix</I> two.
<BR>
Example: In this <I>numeration system,</I> the numeral 110,01
represents the number "6,25"; that is 1 x 2-2 + 1 x 2-1
+ 1 x 2-2.
<BR>
05.03.11<BR>
<B>fixed radix (numeration) system</B><BR>
<B>fixed radix notation</B><BR>
A <I>radix numeration system</I> in which all the <I>digit places,</I>
except perhaps the one with the highest <I>weight,</I> have the same
<I>radix.</I>
<BR>
NOTES
<BR>
1. The weights of successive digit places are successive integral
powers of a single radix, each multiplied by the same factor. Negative
integral powers of the radix are used in the representation of factors.
<BR>
2. A fixed radix numeration system is a particular case of a
<I>mixed radix numeration system</I>; see also Note 2 to 05.03.19.
<BR>
05.03.08<BR>
<B>radix</B><BR>
<B>base (deprecated in this sense)</B><BR>
In a <I>radix numeration system,</I> the positive <I>integer</I> by
which the <I>weight</I> of any <I>digit place</I> is multiplied to
obtain the weight of the digit place with the next higher weight.
<BR>
Example: In the <I>decimal numeration system</I> the radix of
each digit place is 10.
<BR>
NOTE - The term base is deprecated in this sense because
of its mathematical use (see definition in 05.02.01).
<BR>
05.03.07<BR>
<B>radix (numeration) system</B><BR>
A <I>positional representation system</I> in which the ratio of the
<I>weight</I> of any one <I>digit place</I> to the weight of the digit
place with the next lower weight is a positive <I>integer.</I>
<BR>
NOTE - The permissible values of the <I>character</I> in
any digit place range from zero to one less than the <I>radix</I>
of that digit place.
<BR>
05.03.04<BR>
<B>weight</B><BR>
In a <I>positional representation system,</I> the factor by which
the value represented by a <I>character</I> in a <I>digit place</I>
is multiplied to obtain its additive contribution in the representation
of a number.
<BR>
05.03.03<BR>
<B>digit place</B><BR>
<B>digit position</B><BR>
In a <I>positional representation system,</I> each site that may be
occupied by a <I>character</I> and that may be identified by an ordinal
number or by an equivalent identifier.
<BR>
05.03.01<BR>
<B>positional (representation) system</B><BR>
<B>positional notation</B><BR>
Any <I>numeration system</I> in which a number is represented by an
<I>ordered</I> set of <I>characters</I> in such a way that the value
contributed by a character depends upon its position as well as upon
its value.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> What is the legal force of the footnote, given that it quotes
a definition from a document other than ISO 2382 (see 3)?
<LI> Is the footnote wording correct, seeing that the ISO 2382 definition
does not appear to allow any of the common representations (note the
word ``positive'' in 05.03.07)?
<LI> Does the C Standard require that an implementation appear to
use only one representation for each value of a given type?
<LI> Does the C Standard require that all the bits of the value be
significant?
<LI> Does the C Standard require that all possible bit patterns represent
numbers?
<LI> Do the answers to questions (c), (d), and (e) depend on whether
the type is signed or unsigned, and in the former case, on the sign
of the value?
<LI> If it is permitted for certain bit patterns not to represent
values, is generation of such a value by an application (using bit
operators) undefined behavior, or is use of such a value strictly
conforming provided that it is not used with arithmetic operators?
<P>
In particular, are the following five implementations allowed?
</P>
<LI> Unsigned values are pure binary. Signed values are represented
using ones-complement (in other words, positive and negative values
with the same absolute value differ in all bits, and zero has two
representations). Positive numbers have a sign bit of 0, and negative
numbers a sign bit of 1. In both cases, all bits are significant.
<LI> Unsigned values are pure binary. Signed values are represented
using sign-and-magnitude with a pure binary magnitude (note that the
top bit is not ``additive''). Positive numbers have a sign bit
of 0, and negative numbers a sign bit of 1. In both cases, all bits
are significant.
<LI> Unsigned values are pure binary, with all bits significant.
Signed values with an MSB (sign bit) of 0 are positive, and the remainder
of the bits are evaluated in pure binary. Signed values with an MSB
of 1 are negative, and the remainder of the bits are evaluated in
BCD. If ints are 20 bits, then <TT><B>INT_MAX</B></TT> is 524,287 and <TT><B>INT_MIN</B></TT>
is -79,999.
<LI> Signed values are twos-complement using all bits. Unsigned values
are pure binary, but ignoring the MSB (so each number has two representations).
In this implementation, <TT><B>SCHAR_MAX == UCHAR_MAX</B></TT>, <TT><B>SHRT_MAX
== USHRT_MAX</B></TT>, <TT><B>INT_MAX == UINT_MAX</B></TT>, and <TT><B>LONG_MAX == ULONG_MAX</B></TT>.
<LI> Signed values are twos-complement. Unsigned values are pure
binary. In both cases, the top three bits of the value are ignored
(and each number has eight representations). For signed values, the
sign bit is the fourth bit from the top.
<P>
Furthermore:
</P>
<LI> Does the C Standard require that the values of <TT><B>SCHAR_MAX</B></TT>,
<TT><B>SHRT_MAX</B></TT>, <TT><B>INT_MAX</B></TT>, and <TT><B>LONG_MAX</B></TT>, defined in <TT><B>&lt;limits.h></B></TT>
(subclause 5.2.4.2.1) all be exactly one less than a power of 2?
<LI> If the answer to (m) is ``yes,'' then must the exponent
of 2 be exactly one less than <TT><B>CHAR_BIT * sizeof (T)</B></TT>, where <TT><B>T</B></TT>
is <TT><B>signed char</B></TT>, <TT><B>short</B></TT>, <TT><B>int</B></TT>, or <TT><B>long</B></TT>, respectively?
<LI>
Does the C Standard require that the values of <TT><B>UCHAR_MAX</B></TT>,
<TT><B>USHRT_MAX</B></TT>, <TT><B>UINT_MAX</B></TT>, and <TT><B>ULONG_MAX</B></TT>, defined in <TT><B>&lt;limits.h></B></TT>
(subclause 5.2.4.2.1) all be exactly one less than a power of 2?
<LI> If the answer to (p) is ``yes,'' then must the exponent
of 2 be exactly <TT><B>CHAR_BIT * sizeof (T)</B></TT>, where <TT><B>T</B></TT> is <TT><B>unsigned
char</B></TT>, <TT><B>unsigned short</B></TT>, <TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT>, or <TT><B>unsigned
long</B></TT> respectively?
<LI> Does the C Standard require that the absolute values of <TT><B>SCHAR_MIN</B></TT>,
<TT><B>SHRT_MIN</B></TT>, <TT><B>INT_MIN</B></TT>, and <TT><B>LONG_MIN</B></TT>, defined in <TT><B>&lt;limits.h></B></TT>
(subclause 5.2.4.2.1) all be exactly a power of 2 or exactly one less
than a power of 2?
<LI> If the answer to (r) is ``yes,'' then must the exponent
of 2 be exactly one less than <TT><B>CHAR_BIT * sizeof (T)</B></TT>, where <TT><B>T</B></TT>
is <TT><B>signed char</B></TT>, <TT><B>short</B></TT>, <TT><B>int</B></TT>, or <TT><B>long</B></TT> respectively?
<LI> If any of the answers to (m), (p), or (r) is ``no,'' are
there any values for each of these expressions that are permitted
by subclause 5.2.4.2 but prohibited by the C Standard for other reasons,
and if so, what are they?
<LI> Does the C Standard require that the expressions <TT><B>(SCHAR_MIN
+ SCHAR_MAX)</B></TT>, <TT><B>(SHRT_MIN + SHRT_MAX)</B></TT>, <TT><B>(INT_MIN + INT_MAX)</B></TT>,
and <TT><B>(LONG_MIN + LONG_MAX)</B></TT> be exactly 0 or -1? If not, does
it put any restrictions on these expressions?
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Before providing detailed answers, we want to provide some clarified
terminology. For any object type <TT><B>T</B></TT>, the underlying bytes of
the object can be copied into an array of <TT><B>unsigned char</B></TT>:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define N sizeof(T)<BR>
union aligned_buf {<BR>
        T t;<BR>
        unsigned char s[N];<BR>
        } buf;<BR>
T object;<BR>
.....<BR>
        memcpy(buf.s, (const void *)&amp;object, N);
</B></TT><BR>
The <I>object representation</I> of an object consists of the resulting
sequence of <TT><B>N</B></TT> objects of type <TT><B>unsigned char</B></TT> in the buffer.
The object representation depends upon several features of the implementation
such as byte-ordering (``big-endian,'' ``little-endian,''
etc.), ``holes'' (i.e., bits within a scalar object which do
not participate in forming the value of the object), and ``padding''
(i.e., bits in a non-scalar object which lie between the component
scalar objects or after the last scalar object).
<BR>
The <I>value representation</I> of an object is a sequence of bits
structured in a specific conventional way. The scalar components are
listed in their declaration sequence. Each scalar component is a sequence
of bits (the ``participating bits'') arranged in a conventional
ordering. The value representation of floating-point and pointer types
is implementation-defined. The value representation of an integer
type is defined as follows: The least-significant bit (the bit which
represents the integer value 1) is also called the low-order bit or
rightmost bit; the most-significant bit is also called the high-order
bit or leftmost bit. The sign bit (if any) is the leftmost bit.
<BR>
If all the bits in a scalar object representation participate in the
value representation (i.e. no holes or padding), then the value representation
can be referred to simply as the <I>representation.</I> The bits of
the value representation determine a <I>value,</I> which is one discrete
element of an implementation-defined set of values. The conventional
depiction of an integer value is as a decimal integer, optionally
signed, such as 128 or -1.
<BR>
Here is an example.  Consider a (possibly hypothetical) ones-complement
implementation whose <TT><B>int</B></TT> value representation provides one sign
bit and 40 integer bits.
<BR>
<TT><B><PRE>
    +-+---------------------+
    | |                     |
    +-+---------------------+
     1         40
</PRE></B></TT><BR>
Its object representation provides one sign bit, a hole containing
seven non-participating bits, and 40 integer bits (issues of byte
ordering are irrelevant here):
<BR>
<TT><B><PRE>
    +-+------+---------------------+
    | |      |                     |
    +-+------+---------------------+
     1   7        40
</PRE></B></TT><BR>
The value representation containing 41 zero bits designates the value
0:
<BR>
<TT><B><PRE>
    +-+---------------------+
    |0|000     ...       000|
    +-+---------------------+
     1         40
</PRE></B></TT><BR>
Depending upon the implementation, the value representation containing
41 one bits may designate the same value 0, in which case it is indistinguishable
from the other value representation; or it may designate a distinguishable
value, conventionally depicted as -0, which is arithmetically
equal to 0 but distinguishable by bitwise operations.

Now for detailed replies:
<BR>
a) Footnotes are not normative. The <I>legality</I> of a footnote
is beyond the scope of WG14/X3J11.
<BR>
b) Yes, the footnote is correct.
<BR>
c) No, there is no such requirement.
<BR>
d) In view of the discussion above, we assume you mean the following
question: Does the C Standard require that all bits of the object
representation participate in the value representation? For character
types, all bits of the object representation do contribute. See subclauses
7.9.2 (re binary streams) and 7.11.1 (re string functions) for (indirect)
justification. More precisely, any bits that do not contribute to
the value of a character type must not contribute to the value of
any other object type. (Parity bits are an obvious example.) For other
types, the answer is no.
<BR>
e) In view of the discussion above, we assume you mean the following
question: Does the C Standard require that all possible bit patterns
of the object representation represent numbers? For the type <TT><B>unsigned
char</B></TT>, the answer is yes. (And if all values of the type <TT><B>char</B></TT>
are non-negative, then the answer is yes.) Otherwise, the answer is
no.
<BR>
f) No, except for the character types as mentioned above.
<BR>
g) Not applicable, since it is unclear what are the meanings of ``bit
pattern'' and ``value'' in the question; see the answer to
part (e).
<BR>
h) Yes, provided there is no other violation of the C Standard.
<BR>
i) Yes, provided there is no other violation of the C Standard.
<BR>
j) No. It is not a pure binary system.
<BR>
k) Yes, except for <TT><B>SCHAR_MAX == UCHAR_MAX</B></TT> (which is specifically
disallowed), provided there is no other violation of the C Standard.
<BR>
l) Yes, provided there is no other violation of the C Standard.
<BR>
m) Yes, because subclause 6.1.2.5 states that the positive signed
integers have the same representation as the corresponding unsigned
integers, and because signed integers use a pure binary numeration
system. The Committee intended to permit ones complement, twos complement,
and signed magnitude implementation.
<BR>
n) No. There are architectures on which not all bits can be used.
<BR>
p) Yes, because subclause 6.1.2.5 requires unsigned integers to behave
as if a result ``is reduced modulo the number that is one greater
than the largest value that can represented,'' and unsigned integers
use a pure binary numeration system.
<BR>
q) No. The memory occupied by a value of an integer is allowed to
exceed the number of binary digits used to represent the actual value.
<BR>
r) Yes. See the answer to part (m).
<BR>
s) No. See the answer to part (q).
<BR>
t) Not applicable.
<BR>
u) Yes, the expression must evaluate to 0 or -1.
