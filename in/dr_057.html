<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
Must there exist a user-accessible integral type for every pointer? 
If an implementation provides 48-bit pointers, must there be an integral 
type, such as <TT><B>long</B></TT> or <TT><B>int</B></TT>, that is at least 48 bits? Parts 
of the C Standard that may help answer the question follow:
<BR>
Subclause 6.3.4, <B>Cast operators</B>, page 45, lines 30-34 and Footnote 
45:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A pointer may be converted to an integral type. The size of 
integer required and the result are implementation-defined. If the 
space provided is not long enough, the behavior is undefined. 
<BR>
An arbitrary integer may be converted to a pointer. The result 
is implementation-defined.<B>45</B> [Footnote 45: The mapping functions 
for converting a pointer to an integer or an integer to a pointer 
are intended to be consistent with the addressing structure of the 
execution environment.]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Integral types and pointer types are incommensurate. An implementation 
need not provide an integral type that can accept the conversion from 
a pointer type without loss of information.
