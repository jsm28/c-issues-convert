ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg35:
<BR>
Subject: Editorial issue relating to tag declarations in type specifiers.
<BR>
Given the code:
<BR>
<TT><B>void example ()<BR>
	{<BR>
		{<BR>
		struct TAG {int i};<BR>
		}<BR>
		{<BR>
		struct TAG object;	/*</B><I> line 7 </I><B>*/<BR>
		}<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
Does line 7 violate the semantic rule given at the very end of the 
semantics sub-part of subclause 6.5, i.e., ``If an identifier for 
an object is declared with no linkage, the type for the object shall 
be complete by the end of its declarator, ...''?
<BR>
In other words, does <TT><B>struct TAG</B></TT> represent an incomplete type 
on line 7? (I believe that the answer is ``yes,'' but the C 
Standard fails to make that entirely clear.)
<BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.5.2.3 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If a type specifier of the form
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>struct-or-union identifier</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
occurs prior to the declaration that defines the content, the 
structure or union is an incomplete type. It declares a tag that specifies 
a type that may be used only when the size of an object of the specified 
type is not needed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
These statements fail to take full account of scoping issues. The 
statements quoted above should be rephrased to take scope issues into 
account, perhaps as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If a type specifier of the form
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>struct-or-union identifier</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
occurs within a given scope prior to another declaration (in 
the same scope) of the same identifier (which also declares the identifier 
to be a struct or union tag) or if such a type specifier occurs at 
some point within a given scope where no prior declaration of the 
same tag identifier is visible, then the type specifier declares the 
identifier to be a structure or union tag for an incomplete structure 
or union type (respectively). The type so declared may only be used 
when the size of an object of the specified type is not needed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Yes, line 7 violates the semantic rule cited.
Yes, <TT><B>struct TAG</B></TT>
represents an incomplete type.
The application of rules such as scope rules need not be restated
at each relevant point in the C Standard.
