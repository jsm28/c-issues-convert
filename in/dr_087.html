Item 24 - order of evaluation
<BR>
Consider the following program:
<BR>
<TT><B>int g;<BR>
<BR>
int main (void)<BR>
	{<BR>
	int x;<BR>
<BR>
	x = (10, g = 1, 20) + (30, g = 2, 40);	 /*</B><I> Line A </I><B>*/<BR>
	x = (10, f (1), 20) + (30, f (2), 40);	 /*</B><I> Line B </I><B>*/<BR>
	x = (g = 1) + (g = 2);			 /*</B><I> Line C </I><B>*/<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}<BR>
<BR>
int f (int i)<BR>
	{<BR>
	g = i;<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
<BR></B></TT>
Subclause 6.3 makes the statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Between the previous and the next sequence point an object shall 
have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an 
expression.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Consider line A. The full expression (the assignment to <TT><B>x</B></TT>) assigns 
two values (1 and 2) to <TT><B>g</B></TT>. Each such assignment is surrounded 
by sequence points. However, there is no sequence point between the 
two operands of the addition, and therefore no defined order of evaluation 
of the two inner assignments. There are a number of possible interpretations 
of the C Standard that can be made.
<BR><OL>
<LI> Multiple threads of evaluation may take place at one time (or 
equivalently, the evaluation of various parts of the expression may 
be interleaved to any level of detail), provided that anything specified 
to occur before a given sequence point actually takes place before 
anything specified to occur after the same sequence point. (This is 
equivalent to the ``collateral evaluation'' of Algol 68.)
<P>
In this interpretation, the expression is clearly undefined, because 
the two assignments to <TT><B>g</B></TT> may take place simultaneously and interfere 
destructively with one another. However, if this model is applied 
to line B, it yields the same result (since the sequence points occur 
at the same places). This means that, in effect, two function calls 
can be taking place simultaneously, and, if they modify the same object, 
the effect is undefined. This would surprise many users of the C Standard.
</P>
<LI> As (1), but assignments are atomic. This means that <TT><B>g</B></TT> 
has the value 1 or 2, though it is unspecified which. When applied 
to line C, this would also mean that <TT><B>x</B></TT> is specified to be assigned 
the value 3. This seems counter to the quoted provision of subclause 6.3.
<LI> Any expression which completely fills the interval between two 
sequence points, and does not contain any embedded sequence points, 
is an ``atomic sequence.'' The operations of any one atomic 
sequence are carried out together, and cannot be interleaved with 
any other atomic sequence. The order of the atomic sequences is unspecified, 
except that if the ending sequence point of one atomic sequence is 
the same as the starting point of another atomic sequence, they must 
be executed in that order.
<P>
In line A, there are five atomic sequences:
</P>
(i) evaluate 10
<BR>
(ii) assign 1 to <TT><B>g</B></TT>
<BR>
(iii) evaluate 30
<BR>
(iv) assign 2 to <TT><B>g</B></TT>
<BR>
(v) evaluate 20 and 40, add, and assign to <TT><B>x</B></TT>
<BR>
(i) must come before (ii), (iii) must come before (iv), (v) must come 
after (ii) and (iv).
<BR>
In line A this model has the same effect as (2), but it could differ 
in more complex expressions.
<LI> Multiple threads of execution can occur within an expression, 
but all except one are suspended while a function is being executed 
(this may, of course, spawn off new threads). This interpretation 
could be viewed as supported by the wording in subclause 6.6: ``Except 
as indicated, statements are executed in sequence.'' It would have 
the effect of leaving line A undefined while line B is conforming (with 
it being unspecified whether the latter assigns 1 or 2 to <TT><B>g</B></TT>).
</OL>
Which, if any, of these interpretations is correct? If none of them, 
what is the correct interpretation to make?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
In line B, the expression does not exhibit undefined behavior,
but because the order of evaluation of the operands of the addition
operator is not specified and function calls do not overlap,
it is unspecified whether <TT><B>g</B></TT>
will attain the value 1 or 2. Lines C and A violate the quoted restriction
from subclause 6.3, so the behavior is undefined.
