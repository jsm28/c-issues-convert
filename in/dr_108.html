<h2>Defect Report #108</h2>
<b>Submission Date</b>: 03 Dec 93
<br>
<b>Submittor</b>: WG14

<b>Source</b>: Ron Guilmette
<br>
<b>Question</b>
<br>
ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg15:
<br>
Subclause 7.1.3 lists the set of reserved identifiers, but this 
list does not include keywords (subclause 6.1.1).
<br>
Subclause 6.1.1 says (in a <b>Semantics</b> section):
<blockquote>
The above tokens (entirely in lower-case) are reserved (in translation 
phases 7 and 8) for use as keywords, and shall not be used otherwise.
</blockquote>
Based upon the above named sections of the C Standard, I am forced 
to conclude that the following code is strictly conforming. Is this 
a correct conclusion?
<br>
<tt><b>#define double void<br>
#include &lt;math.h&gt;<br>
#undef double<br>
<br>
void example (double d1, double d2)<br>
	{<br>
	d1 = acos (d2);<br>
	}
</b></tt><br>
My impression is that few (if any) existing implementations now accept 
such code. I am therefore inclined to believe that the Committee's 
true intentions were that <i>all</i> keywords (as listed in subclause 
6.1.1) should be considered to be reserved identifiers, at least during 
translation phase 4, and at least while processing <tt><b>#include</b></tt> 
directives which name standard include files provided by the implementation 
(as listed in subclause 7.1.2).
<br>
I believe that the proper way to address this problem would be to 
add another stipulation (regarding reserved identifiers) to subclause 
7.1.2.1. This additional stipulation might read as follows:
<blockquote>
If, during inclusion of any one of the standard headers listed 
in the preceeding section (during translation phase 4) any one of 
the keywords listed in subclause 6.1.1 is defined as a preprocessor 
macro, the behavior is undefined.
</blockquote>
<b>Response</b>
<br>
This program's behavior is undefined because of the restriction on 
inclusion of standard headers in subclause 7.1.2:
<br>
The program shall not have any macros with names lexically identical 
to keywords currently defined prior to the inclusion.
<br>
The Committee's intention was indeed to otherwise allow macros to 
mask keywords.
