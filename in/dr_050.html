<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
Subclause 6.1.3.4 says that the type of a wide character constant 
is <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT>, and subclause 6.1.4 says the type of a wide character 
string is array of <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT>.
<BR>
Subclause 7.1.6 says the typedef name <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> must be defined 
in <TT><B>&lt;stddef.h></B></TT>.
<BR>
Question: When a compiler sees a literal of the form <TT><B>L'...'</B></TT> 
or <TT><B>L"..."</B></TT> must it not check that
<BR><OL>
<LI> The name <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> is visible at that place.
<LI> The name is a typedef name. It could be redefined in an inner 
scope.
<LI> It is a typedef for an integral type. Again, it could be redefined.
</OL>
And then, take that integral type as the meaning of <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT>. 
I suppose it cannot just hope for the best and take a type that makes 
it feel good.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
A similar issue was explained in response to <A HREF="dr_017.html#Question7">Defect Report #017 Question</A> 
7, regarding <TT><B>size_t</B></TT>. The relevant citation here is from subclause 
6.1.3.4, page 29, lines 36-37:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A wide character constant has type <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT>, an integral 
type defined in the <TT><B>&lt;stddef.h></B></TT> header.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The intent of this sentence is to note that a wide character constant 
has an integral type. That integral type is the same integral type 
used to define <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> in the header <TT><B>&lt;stddef.h></B></TT>. The sentence 
imposes no requirement that this particular definition of <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> 
be in scope wherever you write a wide character constant. It certainly 
does not suggest that the translator should honor any other definition 
of <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> that may be in scope, as the type for a wide character 
constant.
<BR>
Rather, the sentence suggests that the translator knows what integral 
type to assign to a wide character constant. The implementation further 
knows to define <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> within the header <TT><B>&lt;stddef.h></B></TT> as 
having that same integral type. Thus, the program has a way of obtaining 
a name for this type, if it chooses - by including the header 
<TT><B>&lt;stddef.h></B></TT>. But it need not invoke that mechanism just to assist 
the translator.
<BR>
It is an unfortunate, but widespread, practice within the C Standard 
to use abbreviated language for describing some types. Thus, subclause 
6.1.4, page 31, lines 5-6 say:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
for wide string literals, the array elements have type <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT>, 
...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
instead of the more long winded (but clearer):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
for wide string literals, the array elements have the same type 
used to define <TT><B>wchar_t</B></TT> in the header <TT><B>&lt;stddef.h></B></TT>, ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
We feel the usage is sufficiently uniform that the meaning intended 
by  the Committee is sufficiently clear, even as we acknowledge that 
the words can be (and have been) misread.
<BR>
So to put the matter crassly, the translator <I>does</I> ``just 
hope for the best and take a type that makes it feel good,'' as 
you conjectured.
