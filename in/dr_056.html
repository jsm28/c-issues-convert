<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
The following requirement is implied in several places, but not explicitly 
stated. It should be explicitly affirmed, or alternative wording adopted.
<BR>
The representation of floating-point values (such as floating-point 
constants, the results of floating-point expressions, and floating-point 
values returned by library functions) shall be accurate to one unit 
in the last position, as defined in the implementation's <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> 
header.
<BR>
Discussion: The values in <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> aren't required to document 
the underlying bitwise representations. If you want to know how many 
bits, or bytes, a floating-point values occupies, use <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT>. 
The <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> values document the mathematical properties of 
the representation, the behaviors that the programmer can count upon 
in analyzing algorithms.
<BR>
It is a quality-of-implementation question as to whether the implementation 
delivers accurate bits throughout the bitwise representation, or alternatively, 
delivers considerably less accuracy. The point being clarified is 
that <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> documents the delivered precision, not the theoretically 
possible precision.
