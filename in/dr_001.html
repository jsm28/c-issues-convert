<B>Question</B> 1
<BR> 
Do functions return values by copying?
<BR>
The C Standard is clear (in subclause 6.3.2.2) that function arguments
are copied, but is not clear (in subclause 6.6.6.4) whether a function's
returned value is also copied. This question becomes an issue in the
assignment statement <TT><B>s=f();</B></TT> where <TT><B>f</B></TT> yields a str
ucture:
is the result defined when the structure <TT><B>s</B></TT> overlaps the structur
e
that <TT><B>f</B></TT> obtained the returned value from?
<BR>
I ask this question because the GNU C compiler does not copy the structure
in this case. When I filed the enclosed bug report [omitted from this
document], Richard Stallman, the author of GNU C, replied that he
didn't think that Standard C required the extra copy. I sympathize
with Stallman's desire for efficient code, and I also would prefer
that the C Standard did not require the extra copy here, but the point
should be made clear in the C Standard.

<B>Correction</B>
<BR> 
<I><B>In subclause 6.6.6.4, page 80, lines 30-32, replace:</B></I>
<BR> 
If the expression has a type different from that of the function in
which it appears, it is converted as if it were assigned to an object
of that type.
<BR> 
<I><B>with:</B></I>
<BR> 
If the expression has a type different from the return type of the
function in which it appears, the value is converted as if by assignment
toan object having the return type of the function.<B>*</B>
<BR> 
[Footnote *: The <TT><B>return</B></TT> statement is not an assignment. The
overlap restriction in subclause 6.3.16.1 does not apply to the case
of function return.]
<BR> 
<I><B>Add to subclause 6.6.6.4, page 80:</B></I>
<BR> 
<B>Example</B>
<BR> 
In:
<BR> 
<TT><B>struct s {double i;} f(void);<BR>
union {struct {int f1;<BR>
               struct s f2;} u1;<BR>
       struct {struct s f3;<BR>
               int f4;} u2;<BR>
      } g;<BR>
struct s f(void)<BR>
        {<BR>
        return g.u1.f2;<BR>
        }<BR>
/*</B><I> ... </I><B>*/<BR>
g.u2.f3 = f();
<BR></B></TT>
the behavior is defined.
