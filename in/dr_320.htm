     <b>Version:</b>&nbsp;1.2<br>
     <b>Date:</b>&nbsp;2006-04-04<br>
     <b>Subject:</b>&nbsp;Scope of variably modified type.</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b></p>

    <p>The first sentence of 6.7.5.2p2 seems to suggest that
    <b>any</b> ordinary identifier both block scope or function
    prototype scope and no linkage <b>has</b> a variably modified
    type. This is clearly wrong.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>
    Rewrite the first sentence of 6.7.5.2p2 to read: 

    <blockquote>
      An ordinary identifier (as defined in 6.2.3) that has a
      variably modified type shall have either block scope or
      function prototype scope, and no linkage.
    </blockquote>
