<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 026: Reservation of macro names
<BR> Is it permitted to <TT><B>#undef</B></TT> a reserved macro name?
Consider the  translation unit:
<BR>
<TT>#include &lt;errno.h><BR> #undef EASTER<BR> #undef EDOM<BR>
#undef __ERRNO_BASE<BR> int error (void) { return errno == ERANGE; }
<BR></TT> Considering each of the three <TT><B>#undef</B></TT>
directives independently,  is each directive permitted in a strictly
conforming program? Is the  translation unit strictly conforming?
<BR> Subclause 7.1.3 describes various classes of reserved identifiers,
 and then states:
<BLOCKQUOTE> If the program declares or defines an identifier with the same 
name as an identifier reserved in that context (other than as allowed 
by 7.1.7), the behavior is undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE> However, this does mention the use of <TT><B>#undef</B></TT>.
Subclause 7.1.7  does so, for certain identifiers, but in rather
ambiguous words:
<BLOCKQUOTE> The use of <TT><B>#undef</B></TT> to remove any macro definition
will  also ensure ...
</BLOCKQUOTE> It has been suggested that this wording merely describes a
strictly  conforming coding technique, rather than establishing a
special case  (rather like the wording about placing the name in
parentheses does).
<BR> Therefore, can a strictly conforming program <TT><B>#undef</B></TT>
a name which  is reserved for any use at that point?
<BR> There is a good reason to allow such an <TT><B>#undef</B></TT>.
A program can  make use of a identifier which is convenient but would
otherwise be  reserved (for example, the identifier <TT><B>EASTER</B></TT>).
There is also  a good reason to forbid it: the macro <TT><B>ERANGE</B></TT>
might actually  be defined as (<TT><B>__ERRNO_BASE + 42</B></TT>).
This leads to the conclusion  that it might be best to permit it for
some names but not others.
<BR> A further example [inserted at the request of BSI] is the
translation  unit:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdlib.h><BR> #undef __INCLUDED_STDLIB_H<BR>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>
<BR></B></TT>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</B>
<BR> Add to the end of subclause 7.1.3:
<BR> If the program removes (with <TT><B>#undef</B></TT>) the macro
definition of  an identifier in the first group listed above, the
behavior is undefined.
<BR><B>Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR>Replace the third bullet in subclause 7.1.3 with the following:
<BR>Each macro name in any of the following subclauses (including <B>Future
 library directions</B>) is reserved for use as specified if any of  its
associated headers is included, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
<BR> Forward reference: 7.1.7.<BR>
