<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Item 5 - handling of <TT><B>char</B></TT> values
<BR>
Values of the type <TT><B>char</B></TT> must be treated as either ``signed'' 
or ``nonnegative'' integers (subclause 6.1.2.5).
<BR><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Is the treatment determined strictly by the value of the expression 
<TT><B>CHAR_MAX == SCHAR_MAX</B></TT>?
<LI> If the treatment is as ``signed'' integers, does the type 
<TT><B>char</B></TT> behave in every instance as the type <TT><B>signed char</B></TT> 
(though of course being a different type)? If not, what are the differences?
<LI> If the treatment is as ``nonnegative'' integers, does 
the type <TT><B>char</B></TT> behave in every instance as the type <TT><B>unsigned 
char</B></TT> (though of course being a different type)? If not, what are 
the differences? In particular, do the "no overflow, reduce modulo" 
semantics apply?
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
a) Yes.
<BR>
b) and c) Yes. Subclause 6.2.1.1, ``As discussed earlier, ...'' 
indicates that this is the intent.
