ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg36:
<BR>
Subject: Tags and name spaces.
<BR>
Should (or must) a conforming implementation correctly 
translate the following code?
<BR>
<TT><B>void *vp;<BR>
struct TAG { int i; };<BR>
<BR>
void f ()<BR>
	{<BR>
	enum TAG { enumerator };<BR>
	(struct TAG *) vp;<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.1.2.3 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, there are separate <I>name spaces</I> for various categories 
of identifiers, as follows:
<BR>
...
<BR>
- the <I>tags</I> of structures, unions,
and enumerations (disambiguated 
by following any of the keywords <TT><B>struct</B></TT>, <TT><B>union</B></TT>,
or <TT><B>enum</B></TT>);...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
A footnote for this subclause states that ``There is only one name 
space for tags even though three are possible.''
<BR>
Given that this statement is only a footnote, and given that there 
are neither any specific constraints nor any specific semantic rules 
violated by the code shown above, it appears that a conforming 
implementation is actually <I>required</I> (by the C Standard, as 
now written) to accept the code shown above (even though this was 
probably not the intent of the Committee). It also seems that the 
code shown above is strictly conforming.
<BR>
If the Committee actually intended that such code should be considered 
to be invalid, then it seems necessary to amend the C Standard to 
make it say that. (Actually, I think that a new constraint is in order 
here.)
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
No change is necessary, because subclause 6.1.2.3 (second item) states
that name spaces of tags are shared. Therefore the inner
<TT><B>enum TAG</B></TT> hides the outer
<TT><B>struct TAG</B></TT>, and therefore the cast
<TT><B>(struct TAG *)</B></TT> attempts to declare a new
<TT><B>struct TAG</B></TT>,
thus violating a constraint in subclause 6.5.
<BR>
A conforming implementation need not translate the given code.
