Item 29 - partial initialization of strings
<BR>
Consider the following program:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdio.h><BR>
<BR>
int main (void)<BR>
	{<BR>
	char s [10] = "Hello";<BR>
<BR>
	printf ("s [9] is %d\n", s [9]);<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
Is this program strictly conforming? If so, is the value of <TT><B>s[9]</B></TT> 
guaranteed to be zero? Subclause 6.5.7 states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If there are fewer initializers in a brace-enclosed list than 
there are members of an aggregate, the remainder of the aggregate 
shall be initialized the same as objects that have static storage 
duration.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
However, the initializer is not brace-enclosed, so this clause does 
not apply.
