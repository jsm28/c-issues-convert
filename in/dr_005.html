<B>Submission Date</B>: 10 Dec 92 <BR> 
<B>Submittor</B>: WG14 <BR> 
<B>Source</B>: X3J11/90-020 (Walter J. Murray)  <BR>
<B>Question</B> 1
<P>According to subclause 6.8.6, a pragma directive ``causes the
implementation to behave in an implementation-defined manner.'' May a
conforming implementation define and recognize a pragma which would
change the semantics of the language? For example, might a conforming
implementation recognize and honor the directive
</P>
<P><TT><B>#pragma UNSIGNED_PRESERVING</B></TT></P>
<P>as a way for a program to request non-standard integral promotions?
</P>
<P>I also pose the corollary question. May a strictly conforming
program contain a pragma directive? According to subclause 4, a strictly
conforming program ``shall use only those features of the language ...
specified in this standard. It shall not produce output dependent on any
unspecified, undefined, or implementation-defined behavior...''
</P><P>If there is no constraint on how a conforming implementation may
behave when encountering a pragma directive, would it not follow that a
strictly conforming program may not contain a pragma directive?
</P>
<B>Response</B>
<BR> The relevant citations are subclause 6.8.6:
<BLOCKQUOTE> A ... <TT><B>pragma</B></TT> ... causes the implementation to
behave in an implementation-defined manner.</BLOCKQUOTE>and clause 4:
<BLOCKQUOTE>A strictly
conforming program ... shall not produce output dependent on any ...
implementation-defined behavior ... </BLOCKQUOTE>
In response to each question:
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Yes, a conforming implementation may define and recognize a pragma
which would change the semantics of the language.
</LI>
<LI>Yes, for example, it might honor <TT><B>UNSIGNED_PRESERVING</B></TT>.
</LI>
<LI> No, a strictly conforming program may not contain a pragma
directive. 
</LI>
<LI> We agree with your conclusion, reasserting answer number 3.
</LI>
</OL>
