<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Item 30 - reservation of identifiers
<BR>
Can a conforming freestanding implementation reserve identifiers? 
Subclause 5.1.2.1 states that only one identifier (the equivalent 
of <TT><B>main</B></TT>) is reserved in a freestanding implementation. Subclause 
7.1.3 states that certain identifiers are reserved, even when the 
corresponding headers are not included. This is a direct contradiction.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The Committee observes that conforming freestanding implementations
tend to vary widely in the library facilities provided, and that the
simple binary choice implied by the above text is really a continuum.
It also notes that it is difficult to provide a C implementation
with no reserved names (not even those beginning with two
underscores). It is therefore felt to be unreasonable to restrict the
names available to implementors of freestanding implementations
compared with hosted implementations.
<BR>
The Committee notes that certain freestanding programs (such as
UNIX kernels) have tended to use names such as <TT><B>exit</B></TT>,
but agrees that existing practice dictates that the authors of such
programs must already be prepared to change such names when using
certain compilers.
<BR>
<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>In subclause 5.1.2.1, page 6, delete:</B></I>
<BR>
There are otherwise no reserved external identifiers.
