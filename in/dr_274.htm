     <b>Subject:</b> meaning of "character" in &lt;string,h&gt;
    functions</p>
    <b>Problem</b> 

    <p>7.21.2.1#2 defines the operation of <tt><b>memcpy</b></tt>
    as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#2] The <tt><b>memcpy</b></tt> function copies n
      characters from the object pointed to by <tt><b>s2</b></tt>
      into the object pointed to by <tt><b>s1</b></tt>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>7.21.2.3#2 defines the operation of <tt><b>strcpy</b></tt>
    as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#2] The <tt><b>strcpy</b></tt> function copies the string
      pointed to by <tt><b>s2</b></tt> (including the terminating
      null character) into the array pointed to by
      <tt><b>s1</b></tt>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Other functions in 7.21 refer to either a string or a set of
    characters in the same way. The definition of "string" is in
    7.1.1#1:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#1] A <i>string</i> is a contiguous sequence of
      characters terminated by and including the first null
      character.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>and that of "character" is in 3.7:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>3.7 [#1] character<br>
       &lt;abstract&gt; member of a set of elements used for the
      organization, control, or representation of data</p>

      <p>3.7.1 [#1] character single-byte character<br>
       &lt;C&gt; bit representation that fits in a byte</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>However, none of this makes it clear whether "character" is
    to be interpreted as having type <tt><b>char</b></tt>,
    <tt><b>signed char</b></tt>, or <tt><b>unsigned char</b></tt>.
    This matters because <tt><b>signed char</b></tt> need not have
    the same sized range of values as <tt><b>unsigned char</b></tt>
    (for example, <tt><b>SCHAR_MIN</b></tt> could be -127, or on a
    10 bit byte system signed <tt><b>char</b></tt>s could have a
    padding bit, with <tt><b>SCHAR_MAX</b></tt> equal to 255 but
    <tt><b>UCHAR_MAX</b></tt> equal to 1023).</p>

    <p>It would be very unfortunate if the <tt><b>mem</b></tt>*
    functions could not copy every possible byte value. The
    <tt><b>str</b></tt>* functions probably ought to access the
    values as if they were plain <tt><b>char</b></tt>.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Append a new paragraph to 7.21.1:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#3] Where a block of characters is accessed through a
      parameter of type <tt><b>void *</b></tt>, each character
      shall be interpreted as if it had type <tt><b>unsigned
      char</b></tt> (and therefore every object representation is
      valid and has a different value). Where it is accessed
      through a parameter of type <tt><b>char *</b></tt>, each
      character shall be interpreted as if it had type
      <tt><b>char</b></tt> (and therefore, if <tt><b>CHAR_MAX -
      CHAR_MIN + 1</b></tt> is less than <tt><b>UCHAR_MAX</b></tt>,
      some byte values may be trap representations or be treated as
      equal to other values).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Discussion</b></p>

    <p>Our intention is that string and memory copies in the
    standard library should be treated as <tt><b>unsigned
    char</b></tt>, similar to 7.21.4.</p>

    <p><b>Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Add a new paragraph 7.21.1#3:</p>

    <blockquote>
      For all functions in this subclause, each character shall be
      interpreted as if it had the type <tt><b>unsigned
      char</b></tt> (and therefore every possible object
      representation is valid and has a different value).
