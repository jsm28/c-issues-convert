Item 11 - alignment and structure padding
<BR>
The existence of structure padding (subclause 6.5.2.1) can be detected 
by a strictly conforming program by use of the <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> operator 
and the <TT><B>offsetof</B></TT> macro.
<BR><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> If a structure has a field of type <TT><B>t</B></TT>, can the alignment 
requirements of the field be different from the alignment requirements 
of objects of the same type that are not members of structures?
<P>
If the answer to (a) is ``yes,'' then where applicable the remaining 
questions should be assumed to have been asked for both objects within 
structures and objects outside structures.
</P>
<LI> If an array has a component type of <TT><B>t</B></TT>, can the alignment 
requirements of the elements of the array be different from those 
of independent variables of type <TT><B>t</B></TT>?
<P>
The alignment requirement of a type is that addresses of objects of 
that type must be multiples of some constant (subclause 3.1); for 
some type <TT><B>t</B></TT>, this is written <TT><B>A(t)</B></TT> in this Defect Report.
</P>
<LI> For any type <TT><B>t</B></TT>, can the expression <TT><B>sizeof (t) % A(t)</B></TT> 
be non-zero (in other words, can <TT><B>A(t)</B></TT> be a value other than 
1, <TT><B>sizeof (t)</B></TT>, or a factor of <TT><B>sizeof (t)</B></TT>)? It would appear 
not, because otherwise adjacent elements of an array of objects of 
type <TT><B>t</B></TT> would either not be correctly aligned, or else would 
not be contiguously allocated.
<LI> Can <TT><B>A(struct foo)</B></TT> be greater than the least common multiple 
of <TT><B>A(type_1)</B></TT>, <TT><B>A(type_2)</B></TT>, ..., <TT><B>A(type_n)</B></TT>, where <TT><B>type_1</B></TT> 
to <TT><B>type_n</B></TT> are the types of the elements of <TT><B>struct foo</B></TT>? 
In particular, if a structure holds exactly one element, can <TT><B>A(structure 
type)</B></TT> be different from <TT><B>A(element type)</B></TT>? (In each case, if 
the answer to (a) is ``yes,'' <TT><B>A(type)</B></TT> should be interpreted 
appropriately.)
<LI> If, at any point in a structure or union (obviously excluding 
the start), there is more than one size of padding that can satisfy 
all alignment requirements, can any size be used, or must the smallest 
(possibly zero) padding be used because that is all that is ``necessary 
to achieve the appropriate alignment?''
<LI> If a structure type has trailing padding to ensure that its 
use as an array element would be correctly aligned, must objects of 
that type which are not array elements also have the padding? If not, 
what is the effect of using <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> to copy the value of one 
such object to another thus?
<P>
<TT><B>struct fred a, b;<BR>
	/*</B><I> ... </I><B>/*<BR>
	memcpy(&amp;a, &amp;b, sizeof (struct fred));
</B></TT><BR>
It appears from subclause 6.3.3.4 (``the size is determined from 
the type of the operand'') that <TT><B>sizeof a</B></TT> must equal <TT><B>sizeof 
(struct fred)</B></TT>. Is this correct?
</P>
<LI> When an element of a structure is in turn a structure, can trailing 
padding of the inner structure be reused to hold other elements of 
the enclosing structure? For example, in:
<P>
<TT><B>struct outer<BR>
	{<BR>
	struct inner { long a; char b; } inner;<BR>
	char c;<BR>
	};
</B></TT></P>
is it permitted for <TT><B>offsetof (struct outer, c)</B></TT> to be less than 
<TT><B>sizeof (struct inner)</B></TT>?
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Subclause 6.1.2.5 says, ``... pointers to qualified or unqualified 
versions of compatible types shall have the same representation and 
alignment requirements.''
<BR>
Subclause 6.5.2.1 says, ``Each non-bit-field member of a structure 
or union object is aligned in an implementation-defined manner appropriate 
to its type.'' And later, ``There may therefore be unnamed padding 
within a structure object, ... as necessary to achieve the appropriate 
alignment.''
<BR>
a) It is possible for an implementation to state generalized requirements 
to satisfy sublause 6.1.2.5. These requirements may be further strengthened 
using the implementation-defined behavior made available in subclause 
6.5.2.1. Yes, the alignment requirements can be different.
<BR>
b) In several places the C Standard states that a single object may 
be treated as an array of one element. Nowhere does it give permission 
for array element types to have different alignment requirements from 
isolated object types.
<BR>
c) <TT><B>sizeof (t)</B></TT> must indeed be a multiple of <TT><B>A(t)</B></TT>.
<BR>
d) Yes. A structure object can have an alignment that is greater than 
the least common multiple of the alignments of its members.
<BR>
e) The phrase ``necessary to achieve the appropriate alignment'' 
is not considered to mean the use of the minimum padding possible. 
The Committee does not see any advantage to changing this phrase.
<BR>
f) Yes. See answer to question (b). <TT><B>sizeof (struct fred)</B></TT> must 
equal <TT><B>sizeof a</B></TT>.
<BR>
g) Such sharing of storage by objects would cause the requirements 
of subclause 6.3 to be violated and is not allowed.
