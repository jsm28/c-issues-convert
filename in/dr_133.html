<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Undefined behavior not previously listed in subclause G2:
<BR>
1. Applying <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> to an enumerate type, as in
<BR>
<TT><B>enum f {c = sizeof (enum f)}
</B></TT><BR>
has undefined behavior.
<BR>
2. A program containing no function called <TT><B>main</B></TT>
has undefined behavior.
<BR>
3. A storage class specifier or type-qualifier modifying the keyword 
<TT><B>void</B></TT> as a function parameter-type-list has undefined
behavior.
<BR>
4. Indexing an array beyond its specified size, as in:
<BR>
<TT><B>int a[4][5];<BR>
a[1][7] = 0;
</B></TT><BR>
has undefined behavior.
<BR>
5. If a ``shall'' or ``shall not'' requirement that appears 
outside of a constraint is violated, the behavior is undefined.
<BR>
6. In pointer-integer conversion, the size of integer required and 
the result are implementation-defined. If the space provided is not 
long enough, the behavior is undefined.
<BR>
7. The result of the <TT><B>%</B></TT> operator is the remainder. In both this 
and the divide operations, if the value of the second operand is zero, 
the behavior is undefined.
<BR>
8. As with any other arithmetic overflow, if the result does not fit 
in the space provided, the behavior is undefined.
<BR>
9. If a file with the same name as a standard header, not provided 
as part of the implementation, is placed in any of the standard places 
for a source file to be included, the behavior is undefined.
<BR>
10. If the signal handler <TT><B>func(int sig)</B></TT> executes a <TT><B>return</B></TT> 
statement and the value of <TT><B>sig</B></TT> was <TT><B>SIGFPE</B></TT> or any other 
implementation-defined value corresponding to a computational exception, 
the behavior is undefined.
<BR>
11. If any signal is generated by an asynchronous signal handler, 
the behavior is undefined.
<BR>
12. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior 
is undefined.
<BR>
13. If a fully expanded macro replacement list contains a function-like 
macro name as its last preprocessing token, it is unspecified whether 
this macro name may be subsequently replaced. If the behavior of the 
program depends upon this unspecified behavior, then the behavior 
is undefined. For example:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define f(a)	a*g<BR>
#define g(a)	f(a)
</B></TT><BR>
the invocation <TT><B>f(2) (9)</B></TT> results in undefined behavior.
<BR>
14. A call to a library function that exceeds an <B>Environmental limit</B>
has undefined behavior.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The C Standard makes it sufficiently clear that the described behaviors 
are undefined. The next revision of the C Standard can include a more 
comprehensive list.
