ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg32:
<BR>
Subject: Using things declared as ``<TT><B>extern</B></TT>
(qualified) <TT><B>void</B></TT>.''
<BR>
May a conforming implementation fail to correctly 
translate a translation unit containing the following declarations?
<BR>
<TT><B>extern const void etext;<BR>
const void *vp = &amp;etext;
</B></TT><BR>
Background:
<BR>
<A HREF="dr_012.html">Defect Report #012</A> discusses at length the issue of applying unary 
<TT><B>&</B></TT> to an expression whose type is some void type. The conclusion 
of that discussion seem to be that although unary <TT><B>&</B></TT> <I>may 
not</I> be applied to an expression having <I>the</I>
<TT><B>void</B></TT> type (because 
such expressions are not lvalues) it <I>is</I> permissible to apply 
unary <TT><B>&</B></TT> to an expression whose type is some qualified version 
of <TT><B>void</B></TT>. The text of the interpretation
for <A HREF="dr_012.html">Defect Report #012</A> even goes so far 
as to actively recommend the practice of declaring things to be <TT><B>extern</B></TT> 
and to have some qualified void type (so that the address may then 
be taken).
<BR>
The question raised herein is a different one. Tom Pennello has pointed 
out the following rule from the second <B>Semantics</B> paragraph of subclause 
6.7:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If an identifier declared with external linkage is used in an 
expression (other than as part of the operand of a <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> operator), 
somewhere in the entire program there shall be exactly one external 
definition for the identifier; ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, as Tom has noted, applying unary <TT><B>&</B></TT> to an entity declared 
to be both <TT><B>extern</B></TT>
and of some qualified void type is a ``use'' 
of that entity which would necessarily force you to supply a definition 
of that entity, somewhere in the program. But as Tom has further noted, 
there is simply no way to accomplish that (in a strictly conforming 
program) because of the following rule (given in subclause 6.5):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All declarations ... that refer to the same object or function shall 
specify compatible types.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, if you either define or fail to define <TT><B>etext</B></TT>, it would 
appear that the behavior is undefined. Is this a correct interpretation?
<BR>
(Footnote: It would appear that a strictly conforming program may 
contain a mere declaration of an <TT><B>extern</B></TT>
entity whose type is any qualified 
or unqualified void type, but that any use of such an entity within 
an expression, other than within a <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> expression, renders 
the program not strictly conforming.)
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Applying <TT><B>&</B></TT> to an identifier of type
<TT><B>const void</B></TT>
has undefined behavior.
Thus an implementation can define any semantics it wishes.
A strictly conforming program cannot contain such a construct.
