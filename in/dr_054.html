<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
Are the string handling functions defined in subclause 7.11 that have 
an explicit length specification (<TT><B>memcpy</B></TT>, <TT><B>memmove</B></TT>, <TT><B>strncpy</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>strncat</B></TT>, <TT><B>memcmp</B></TT>, <TT><B>strncmp</B></TT>, <TT><B>strxfrm</B></TT>, <TT><B>memchr</B></TT>, 
and <TT><B>memset</B></TT>) well-defined when the length is specified as zero?
<BR>
Taking <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> as an example, the description in subclause 7.11.2.1 
states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> function copies <TT><B>n</B></TT> characters from the 
object pointed to by <TT><B>s2</B></TT> into the object pointed to by <TT><B>s1</B></TT>. 
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior 
is undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The response to <A HREF="dr_042.html"> Defect Report #042 Question 1</A> indicates that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... the ``objects'' referred to by subclause 7.11.2.1 
are exactly the regions of data storage pointed to by the pointers 
and dynamically determined to be of <TT><B>N</B></TT> bytes in length (i.e. 
treated as an array of <TT><B>N</B></TT> elements of character type).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Since, by definition, objects consist of at least one byte, this would 
imply that <TT><B>s1</B></TT> and <TT><B>s2</B></TT> are not pointing to objects when 
<TT><B>N</B></TT> is zero and thus are outside the domain of the function leading 
to undefined behavior.
<BR>
I do not recall whether this was the Committee's intent or not, but 
it would seem that some clarification is in order.
<BR>
<B>Correction</B>
<BR>
<I><B>Add to subclause 7.11.1, page 162:</B></I>
<BR>
Where an argument declared as <TT><B>size_t n</B></TT> specifies the length 
of the array for a function, <TT><B>n</B></TT> can have the value zero on a 
call to that function. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the description 
of a particular function in this subclause, pointer arguments on such 
a call must still have valid values, as described in subclause 7.1.7. 
On such a call, a function that locates a character finds no occurrence, 
a function that compares two character sequences returns zero, and 
a function that copies characters copies zero characters.
