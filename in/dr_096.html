ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg3:
<BR>
Subclause 6.5.4.2 <B>Array declarators</B> fails to contain any constraint 
which would prohibit the element type in an array declarator from 
being a type which is not an object type. (Note that subclause 6.1.2.5 
seems to suggest that such usage is prohibited by saying that ``An 
<I>array type</I> describes a contiguously allocated
nonempty set of objects ...'' 
But this still leaves the matter rather unclear.)
<BR>
I believe that some new constraint prohibiting the element type in 
an array declarator from being a non-object type (at least in some 
obvious cases) is clearly needed.
<BR>
Please consider the case of an array declarator, occuring at some 
point within a given translation unit, and indicating an element type 
<TT><B>T</B></TT>, where <TT><B>T</B></TT> is one of the following:
<BR><OL>
<LI> A function type.
<LI> A void type.
<LI> An incomplete struct or union type which is <I>never</I> completed 
within the given translation unit.
<LI> An incomplete struct or union type which <I>is</I> completed 
later within the given translation unit.
<LI> An incomplete array type which is <I>never</I> completed within 
the given translation unit.
<LI> An incomplete array type which <I>is</I> completed later within 
the given translation unit.
</OL>
I believe that it should be abundantly clear that the C Standard should 
contain a constraint prohibiting array declarators where the specified 
element type is either (1) or (2). Essentially all existing implementations 
already issue diagnostics for such usage.
<BR>
Also, in cases where an array declarator uses either a (3) or a (5) 
as the element type, it seems eminently reasonable to require diagnostics 
- and indeed, many existing implementations already do issue 
diagnostics for such usage - but this is perhaps debatable.
<BR>
Cases (4) and (6) from the above list are <I>entirely</I> debatable. 
Existing practice among so-called ``conforming'' C compilers 
varies with respect to these cases (in which an element type is completed 
at some point <I>after</I> use of the type, as an element type, in 
an array declarator). Here are two examples:
<BR>
<TT><B>struct S array[10];			/*</B><I> ok? </I><B>*/<BR>
struct S { int member; };	/*</B><I> type completed now </I><B>*/<BR>
<BR>
int array_of_array[][];		/*</B><I> ok? </I><B>*/<BR>
int array_of_array[5][5];	/*</B><I> type completed now </I><B>*/</B></TT>
<BR>
As I say, I believe that the very least the Committee should do is 
to add a constraint requiring diagnostics for array declarators whose 
element types fall into categories (1) or (2). The Committee may wish 
to provide an even more stringent interpretation of subclause 6.1.2.5 
and also require diagnostics for element types falling into categories 
(3) and/or (5). The Committee may even wish to take the simplest 
approach to this entire problem, and simply require diagnostics for 
<I>any</I> case in which an array declarator specifies an element 
type which is not (already) an object type.
<BR>
Regardless of which choice is made, I feel strongly that it is important 
for subclause 6.5.4.2 <B>Array declarators</B> to be revised to fully 
reflect both common sense and (to the extent possible) the intent 
of subclause 6.1.2.5.
<BR>
Footnote: Note that while is it <I>always</I> possible for a given 
incomplete struct or union type to be completed somewhere later within 
the same scope and same translation unit where it is used, and while 
it is <I>often</I> possible to complete a given incomplete array type 
later within the same scope and same translation unit where it is 
used (as illustrated by the above examples) it can sometimes be <I>impossible</I> 
to <I>ever</I> complete a given array type later within its scope 
and translation unit. This will certainly be the case whenever the 
array type in question is <I>not</I> used to declare an entity having 
<I>some</I> linkage (either internal or external).
<BR>
Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>
void example ()<BR>
	{<BR>
	void *vp = (int (*)[][]) 0;	/*</B><I> abstract declarator<BR>
		declares no  object - type can't be completed </I><B>*/<BR>
	int array[][];	/*</B><I> no linkage - type can't ever be<BR>
			completed </I><B>*/<BR>
	}
</B></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
I mention these cases only because they may potentially have some 
small bearing upon the Committee's deliberations of the central issues 
of this Defect Report.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Subclause 6.1.2.5 does clearly state, ``An <I>array type</I> describes 
a contiguously allocated nonempty set of objects with a particular 
member object type, called the <I>element type.</I><B>17</B>'' Footnote 
17 and the first paragraph of subclause 6.1.2.5 both state that object 
types do not include incomplete types. Nor do object types include 
function types. Thus, the array element type must not be any of the 
items you have listed. A diagnostic is not required. The Committee 
believes that whether or not a diagnostic is produced is an
issue of quality of implementation.
