     <b>Subject:</b> Equality operators</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b><br>
     When discussing the comparison operators, 6.5.8 says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [#4] For the purposes of these operators, a pointer to an
      object that is not an element of an array behaves the same as
      a pointer to the first element of an array of length one with
      the type of the object as its element type.
    </blockquote>
    Given that the restrictions on the arguments for pointer
    comparison and pointer equality are very different, it would be
    advisable to repeat this wording in 6.5.9. The only wording
    that implies that this applies to equality operators is the bit
    about "analogous" in 6.5.9#3. Since other restrictions (e.g.
    that the pointers must be in the same array) do <em>not</em>
    apply to equality operators, it is at best ambiguous whether
    this text applies. Therefore for clarity it should be repeated.
    
    <hr>

    <p><b>Technical Corrigendum</b><br>
     Paragraph 4 from 6.5.8 should be duplicated in the Semantics
    section of 6.5.9.</p>
