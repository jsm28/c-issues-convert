ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg7:
<BR>
Subclause 6.6.6.4 <B>The <TT>return</TT></B> statement says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the expression has a type different from that of the function 
in which it appears, it is converted as if it were assigned to an 
object of that type.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is nonsensical. The type of the containing function is a function 
type, and that's different from an object type. I believe that should 
be changed to read:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the expression has a type different from that of the return 
type of the function in which it appears, it is converted as if it 
were assigned to an object having the same type as the return type 
of the containing function.
