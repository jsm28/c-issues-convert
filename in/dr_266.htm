     <b>Subject:</b> overflow of <tt><b>sizeof</b></tt></p>
    <b>Problem</b> 

    <p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre>
<tt><b>  char x [SIZE_MAX / 2][SIZE_MAX / 2];
    size_t s = sizeof x;
</b></tt>
</pre>

    <p>The size of <tt><b>x</b></tt> cannot be fitted into an
    object of type <tt><b>size_t</b></tt>. Assuming that
    <tt><b>SIZE_MAX</b></tt> is 65535, what is the value of
    <tt><b>s</b></tt> ? More generally, which of the following is,
    or should be, the case ?</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The value is reduced modulo <tt><b>(SIZE_MAX +
      1)</b></tt>.</li>

      <li>The behaviour is undefined (or perhaps
      implementation-defined).</li>

      <li>The program is forbidden to use <tt><b>sizeof</b></tt>
      with such a large argument.</li>

      <li>The implementation must ensure that no object can be
      larger than <tt><b>SIZE_MAX</b></tt> bytes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>6.5.3.4#2 says in part:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [#2] The <tt><b>sizeof</b></tt> operator yields the size (in
      bytes) of its operand, which may be an expression or the
      parenthesized name of a type. The size is determined from the
      type of the operand. The result is an integer.
    </blockquote>
    Note that there is no indication that the result may be other
    than the correct size. 

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>One of:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Append to 6.5.3.4#4: 

        <blockquote>
          <p>If the size is too large to fit in an object of type
          <tt><b>size_t</b></tt>, it is converted to that type in
          the manner described in subclause 6.3.1.3.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        Append to 6.5.3.4#4: 

        <blockquote>
          <p>If the size is too large to fit in an object of type
          <tt><b>size_t</b></tt>, it is replaced by an
          implementation-defined value.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        Add a new constraint paragraph after 6.5.3.4#1: 

        <blockquote>
          <p>[#1a] The <tt><b>sizeof</b></tt> operator shall not be
          applied to an operand whose size, in bytes, is larger
          than the maximum value of the type
          <tt><b>size_t</b></tt>.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        Append to 6.5.3.4#4: 

        <blockquote>
          <p>The implementation shall ensure that the type
          <tt><b>size_t</b></tt> is large enough to hold the result
          of all uses of the <tt><b>sizeof</b></tt> operator.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>[Some of these are less than wonderful, and consideration
    should also be given to the interaction with VLAs.]</p>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Discussion</b></p>

    <p>The committee has deliberated and decided that more than one
    interpretation is reasonable. Translation limits do not apply
    to objects whose size is determined at runtime.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <tt><b>sizeof(a[SIZE_MAX/2][SIZE_MAX/2]);</b></tt>
    </blockquote>
    The program is not strictly conforming because it exceeds an
    environmental limit. <br>
     If the implementation generates code, there is no requirement
    for a diagnostic. In the event that <tt><b>sizeof</b></tt> is
    called on the object, a diagnostic should be issued, but not
    required. <br>
     VLAs are a special case. 

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>
    The program is not strictly conforming because it exceeds an
    environmental limit. If the implementation generates code,
    there is no requirement for a diagnostic. In the event that
    <tt><b>sizeof</b></tt> is called on the object, a diagnostic
    can be issued, but is not required.
