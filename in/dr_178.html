<BODY><H2>Defect Report #178</H2> 
<B>Submission Date</B>: 06 Feb 96
<BR>
<B>Submittor</B>: WG14
<BR>
<B>Source</B>: Frank Farance
<BR>
<B>Question</B>
<BR> Is the following conforming?
<BR>
<TT>  <B>struct x<BR>                 {<BR>                 char y[1];<BR>
                 };<BR>         struct x *z;<BR>
<BR>         z = (struct x *) malloc(sizeof (*z) + 100);<BR>        
z- y[5] = '?';</B>
<BR>
</TT>
<A HREF="dr_051.html">Defect Report #051</A> states that this isn't conforming behavior
because the pointer arithmetic for the larger structure might not be
compatible  with a smaller structure. Thus, it recommends the <I>safer</I>
 idiom:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define HUGE_ARR  1000    /* </B><I>or bigger than ever needed</I><B> */<BR>    
    struct x<BR>                 {<BR>                 char
y[HUGE_ARR];<BR>                 };<BR>         struct x *z;<BR>
<BR>         z = (struct x *) malloc(sizeof (*z) + 100);<BR>        
z- y[5] = '?';</B>
</TT><BR> However, <A HREF="dr_073.html">Defect Report #073</A> states that the <I>safer</I>
idiom  is undefined behavior because it is possible to implement the
operator 
<TT><B>- </B></TT> as first fetching all of <TT><B>*z</B></TT>, then
selecting <TT><B>y[5]</B></TT>  from it. This approach would cause
access to unallocated memory. Thus,  the operation produces undefined
behavior.
<BR> These responses are inconsistent. At the Oct 95 meeting in Nashua 
NH, WG14 indicated that it wanted to designate this as undefined
behavior.
