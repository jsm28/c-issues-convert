<H2>Defect Report #140</H2>
<B>Submission Date</B>: 27 Jul 94

<BR>
<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Subclause 7.9.5.6 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><B>setvbuf</B></TT> function may be used only after the stream 
... has been associated with an open file and before any other operation 
is performed on the stream.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
There are two related questions associated with this statement.
<BR>
1. What does ``performed'' mean?
<BR><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Does it include attempts that failed (such as <TT><B>fread</B></TT> on 
output file, etc.)?
<LI> In particular, does it include a failed attempt to <TT><B>setvbuf</B></TT>?
<LI> What about <TT><B>fprintf(f, "")</B></TT>?
</OL>
2. What does ``other operation'' mean?
<BR><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Does it include <TT><B>setvbuf</B></TT> itself?
<LI> Are <TT><B>ferror</B></TT> and <TT><B>feof</B></TT> operations?
<LI> What about <TT><B>clearerr</B></TT>?
</OL>
Reasons for asking:
<BR>
It would seem reasonable to try to get a very large buffer in some 
applications by attempting to do a <TT><B>setvbuf</B></TT> with, say, 1 MB of 
buffer space. If that fails, try again with 0.5 MB, etc. Is this allowed?
<BR>
My <I>guess</I> as to the interpretation is as follows:
<BR>
1. An operation is ``performed'' even if it fails for whatever 
reason.
<BR>
2. All functions defined in subclause 7.9 are to be treated as ``operations.''
<BR>
This is unsatisfactory, as the above approach of attempting to find 
a good buffer size would fail.
<BR>
In the Rationale, it states ``The general principle is to provide 
portable code with a means of requesting the most appropriate popular 
buffering style, but not to <I>require</I> an implementation to support 
these styles.'' [Emphasis added.]
<BR>
I interpret this as saying that <TT><B>setvbuf</B></TT> is an advisory call 
and need not be acted on. However, my questions above still stand 
as there seems to be no way of negotiating an agreement on good acceptable 
buffer sizes.
<BR>
I believe that a clarification is required.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
As you say, ``<TT><B>setvbuf</B></TT> is an advisory call and need not be 
acted on.'' That is to say, the C Standard allows it to fail. Therefore, 
discussions of detailed constraints such as you describe could only 
constitute non-normative advice to programmers or implementers. The 
Committee does not have any specific advice to give in this regard.
