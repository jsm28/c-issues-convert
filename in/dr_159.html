<BR>
<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>  Defect Report UK 007: Consistency of the
C Standard  Defects exist in the way the Standard refers to itself.
<BR>
<B>Part 1</B>
<BR> The introduction to the C Standard reads in part:
<BR> The introduction, the examples, the footnotes, the references, 
and the annexes are not part of this International Standard.
<BR> While it is not, strictly speaking, an inconsistency for text that
 is not part of the C Standard to specify which text is part of the  C
Standard, it is confusing for this to be the case when other text  that
<I>looks</I> like part of the C Standard isn't - the examples  and
footnotes.
<BR> In particular, placing this information - necessary for
interpreting  the text of the C Standard itself - outside that text
causes a  danger that, when some other document is produced that
purports to  contain the full text of the C Standard, the Introduction
will be  omitted while the footnotes and examples are retained. A reader
of  such a document who is not aware of the text of the introduction
will  then be misled as to the C Standard's contents. Whilst this is not
 the responsibility of ISO, it is another reason for regularizing the 
situation.
<BR> Note that this has definitely happened in the case of <I>The
Annotated  ANSI C Standard</I> by Herbert Schildt, and I have been
informed (but  have not confirmed) that it has also happened with the
version of  the C Standard distributed by the Australian National Body.
<BR>
<B>Part 2</B>
<BR> The introduction to the C Standard reads in part:
<BR> The language clause (clause 7) ... The library clause (clause  8)
...
<BR> These references are wrong.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</B>
<BR> In the Introduction, change:
<BR> The introduction, the examples, the footnotes, the references, 
and the annexes are not part of this International Standard.
<BR> The language clause (clause 7) ...
<BR> The library clause (clause 8) ...
<BR> to:
<BR> As specified in the definitions and conventions clause (clause 
3), this introduction, the examples, the footnotes, the references,  and
the annexes are not part of this International Standard.
<BR> The language clause (clause 6) ...
<BR> The library clause (clause 7) ...
<BR> Insert at the start of clause 3:
<BR> The introduction, the examples, the footnotes, the references, 
and the annexes are not part of this International Standard.<BR>
