<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Item 14 - stability of addresses
<BR>
Is the address of an object constant throughout its lifetime? For 
example, if a pointer to an object is written to a binary file using 
<TT><B>fwrite</B></TT>, and then read back later during the same run of the 
program using <TT><B>fread</B></TT>, is it guaranteed to compare equal to the 
address of the original object taken again?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The C Standard does not explicitly state that the address of an object
remains constant throughout the life of the object. That this is the
intent of the Committee can be inferred from the fact that an
address constant is considered to be a constant expression. The
framers of the C Standard considered that it was so obvious that
addresses should remain constant that they neglected to craft words
to that effect.
<BR>
The Committee should revisit this issue during the revision of the
C Standard.
