     <b>Source:</b> Clive D.W. Feather &lt;clive@demon.net&gt;<br>
     <b>Version:</b> 1.1<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2002-03-06<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> ordering of "defined" and macro
    replacement</p>
    <b>Problem</b> 

    <p>Consider the code:</p>
<pre>
<tt><b>  #define repeat(x) x &amp;&amp; x    //</b> <i>Line 1</i> <b>  #if repeat(defined fred)    //</b> <i>Line 2</i> 
</tt>
</pre>

    <p>and the code:</p>
<pre>
<tt><b>  #define forget(x) 0         //</b> <i>Line 3</i> <b>  #if forget(defined fred)    //</b> <i>Line 4</i> 
</tt>
</pre>

    <p>6.10.1#3 says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#3] Prior to evaluation, macro invocations in the list of
      preprocessing tokens that will become the controlling
      constant expression are replaced (except for those macro
      names modified by the <tt><b>defined</b></tt> unary
      operator), just as in normal text. If the token
      <tt><b>defined</b></tt> is generated as a result of this
      replacement process or use of the <tt><b>defined</b></tt>
      unary operator does not match one of the two specified forms
      prior to macro replacement, the behavior is undefined.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Does line 2 "generate" a <tt><b>defined</b></tt> operator ?
    Is line 4 strictly conforming code, or does the fact that macro
    expansion "forgets" the <tt><b>defined</b></tt> operator cause
    a problem ?</p>

    <p>The restriction was clearly intended to make code like the
    following undefined:</p>
<pre>
<tt><b>   #define jim defined
    #if jim loves sheila
</b></tt>
</pre>

    <p>I would guess that the original intention was that any
    <tt><b>defined X</b></tt> pair in the original source worked
    correctly. The proposed change would resolve this.</p>

    <p>In addition, given the order of events, it is unsuitable to
    say that a <tt><b>defined X</b></tt> expression is "evaluated".
    Rather it should be described as a textual substitution.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change 6.10.1#1 to read:</p>

    <blockquote>
      [...] 
<pre>
<tt><b>     defined identifier</b></tt>
</pre>
      or 
<pre>
<tt><b>     defined ( identifier )</b></tt>
</pre>
      which are replaced by the token <tt><b>1</b></tt> if the
      identifier is currently<br>
       [...]<br>
       subject identifier), or the token <tt><b>0</b></tt> if it is
      not.
    </blockquote>
    and #3 to read: 

    <blockquote>
      [#3] Prior to evaluation, the list of preprocessing tokens
      that will become the controlling constant expression is
      examined. Firstly all expressions using the
      <tt><b>defined</b></tt> operator are replaced as described
      above, and then macro invocations are replaced, just as in
      normal text. If the token <tt><b>defined</b></tt> appears in
      the list after the replacement process, or the use of the
      <tt><b>defined</b></tt> unary operator does not match one of
      the two specified forms prior to macro replacement, the
      behavior is undefined. After all [...]
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>The standard does not clearly specify what happens in this
    case, so portable programs should not use these sorts of
    constructs.</p>
