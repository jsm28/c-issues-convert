<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
In subclause 7.12.2.3, page 172, the example is not strictly conforming. 
The <TT><B>mktime</B></TT> return is compared against <TT><B>-1</B></TT> instead of <TT><B>(time_t)-1</B></TT>, 
which could cause a problem with a strictly conforming implementation.

<B>Question</B> 3
<BR>
Footnote 1, page 1, says that the C Standard comes with a Rationale; 
it doesn't.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The footnote actually states, in part, ``It is accompanied by a 
Rationale document that explains ...'' And indeed, the C Standard 
was accompanied by such a document throughout its approval process. 
ISO, unfortunately, has elected not to distribute the Rationale with 
the C Standard. ``Accompanied by'' does not promise ``comes 
with'' when you buy the C Standard.
