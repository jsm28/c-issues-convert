[Question was revised in Jun 94.]
<BR>
ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg16:
<BR>
Does the C Standard draw any significant distinction between ``undefined 
values'' and ``undefined behavior?'' (It appears that it 
does, but if it does, that fact is not always apparent.)
<BR>
Just to give two examples which, it would appear, involve the generation 
(in a running program) of undefined values (as opposed to totally 
undefined behavior at either compile-time or link-time or run-time) 
I provide the following two citations.
<BR>
Subclause 6.3.8 <B>Relational operators</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the objects pointed to are not members of the same aggregate 
or union object, the <I>result</I> is undefined,...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(Emphasis added.)
<BR>
Subclause 7.5.2.1 <B>The <TT>acos</TT> function</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A domain error occurs for arguments not in the range [-1,+1].
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The issue of ``undefined values'' versus ``undefined behavior'' 
has great significance and importance to people doing compiler testing. 
It is generally accepted that the C Standard's use of the term ``undefined 
behavior'' is meant to imply that absolutely <I>anything</I> can 
happen at any time, e.g. at compile-time, at link-time, or at run-time. 
Thus, people testing compilers must either totally avoid writing test 
cases which involve any kind of ``undefined behavior'' or else 
they must treat any such test cases which they <I>do</I> write as 
strictly ``quality of implementation'' tests which may validly 
cause errors at compile-time, at link-time, or at run-time.
<BR>
If however the C Standard recognizes the separate existence of ``undefined 
values'' (whose mere creation <I>does not</I> involve wholly ``undefined 
behavior'') then a person doing compiler testing could write a 
test case such as the following, and he/she could also expect (or 
possibly demand) that a conforming implementation should, 
at the very least, compile this code (and possibly also allow it to 
execute) without ``failure.''
<BR>
<TT><B> int array1[5];<BR>
int array2[5];<BR>
int *p1 = &amp;array1[0];<BR>
int *p2 = &amp;array2[0];<BR>
<BR>
int foo()<BR>
	{<BR>
	int i;<BR>
	i = (p1 > p2);  /*</B><I> Must this be "successfully translated"? </I><B>*/<BR>
	1/0;             /*</B><I> Must this be "successfully translated"? </I><B>*/<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
So the bottom line question is this: Must the above code be ``successfully 
translated'' (whatever that means)? (See the footnote attached 
to subclause 5.1.1.3.)
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The C Standard uses the term ``indeterminately valued''
not ``undefined value.''
Use of an indeterminate valued object results in undefined
behavior.
<BR>
The footnote to subclause 5.1.1.3 points out that an implementation
is free to produce any number of diagnostics as long as a valid
program is still correctly translated.
<BR>
If an expression whose evaulation would result in undefined behavior
appears in a context where a constant expression is required, the
containing program is not strictly conforming.
Furthermore, if <I>every</I> possible execution of a given program
would result in undefined behavior, the given program is not
strictly conforming.
<BR>
A conforming implementation must not fail to translate a strictly
conforming program simply because <I>some</I> possible execution
of that program would result in undefined behavior.
Because <TT><B>foo</B></TT> might never be called, the example given
must be successfully translated by a conforming implementation.
