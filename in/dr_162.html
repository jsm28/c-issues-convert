<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those declared in standard headers refer to
  the identifiers declared in  those standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 010: <TT><B>gmtime</B></TT> and <TT><B>localtime</B></TT>
<BR> The C Standard's description of the static objects used by <TT><B>
 time.h </B></TT>  functions is misleading.
<BR> Subclause 7.12.3 reads in part:
<BR> these functions return values in one of two static objects:  a
broken-down time structure and an array of <TT><B>char</B></TT>.
Execution  of any of the functions may overwrite the information
returned in  either of these objects by any of the other functions.
<BR> Does this mean that, for example, <TT><B>localtime</B></TT> and<B></B>
<TT><B>gmtime</B></TT>  must share a single broken-down time
structure, and so the value returned  from <TT><B>gmtime</B></TT>, if
not a null pointer, must equal the value returned  from <TT><B>localtime</B></TT>
(and this value cannot change during execution  of the program)?
<BR> The wording <I>the other functions</I> also implies that a call 
to <TT><B>gmtime</B></TT> can overwrite a previous call to <TT><B>localtime</B></TT>,
 but not a previous call to <TT><B>gmtime</B></TT>. This is clearly ridiculous.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR> In subclause 7.12.3, change:
<BR> these functions return values in one of two static objects:  a
broken-down time structure and an array of <TT><B>char</B></TT>.
Execution  of any of the functions may overwrite the information
returned in  either of these objects by any of the other functions.
<BR> to:
<BR> these functions each return a pointer to an object of static 
storage duration after assigning a value to it. Execution of any of 
these functions may overwrite the information returned in any of these 
objects by a previous call to any of these functions.<BR>
<B>Future Change</B><BR>
In subclause 7.12.3, change:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Except for the <TT><B>strftime</B></TT> function, these functions return
values in one of two static objects: a broken-down time structure and an array of <TT><B>char</B></TT>.
Execution of any of the functions may overwrite the information returned in either of
these objects by any of the other functions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
to:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Except for the <TT><B>strftime</B></TT> function, these functions each
return a pointer to one of two types of static objects:  a broken-down time 
structure or an array of <TT><B>char</B></TT>.  Execution of any of the functions that return a pointer to one of these object types may overwrite the information in any object of the same
type pointed to by the value retruned from any previous call to any of them.
