<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
Does the description in subclause 7.3.1 imply that the characters 
defined in subclause 5.2.1 are always classified as implied by subclause 
5.2.1 regardless of the locale specified?
<BR>
In particular, do the characters <TT><B>'a'</B></TT> through <TT><B>'z'</B></TT> and <TT><B>'A'</B></TT> 
through <TT><B>'Z'</B></TT> have to be classified as ``lower case and ``upper 
case,'' respectively, in every locale?
<BR>
The specific lines needing interpretation are lines 20-21 in subclause 
7.3.1.6, page 103, and lines 16-17 in subclause 7.3.1.10, page 104. 
The word ``or'' can be interpreted to require a superset of 
the characters specified as lower/upper case in subclause 5.2.1 or 
to allow an implementation-defined set of characters (which might 
contain none of the subclause 5.2.1 designated lower/upper case characters).

Does the description in subclause 7.3.1 imply that the characters

5.2.1 regardless of the locale specified?

Answer: By subclause 7.3.1.6 <B>The <TT>islower</TT> function</B> and subclause 
7.3.1.10 <B>The <TT>isupper</TT> function</B> which refer to lower- and 
upper-case letters, respectively, and by subclause 5.2.1: ``basic 
source and basic execution character sets shall have at least ... 
upper-case letters of the English alphabet'' (with example) ... 
``lower-case letters of the English alphabet'' (with example), 
and by subclause 5.2.1.2 ``The single-byte characters defined in 
subclause 5.2.1 shall be present,'' which refers to multibyte characters, 
therefore, yes, the characters defined in subclause 5.2.1 are always 
classified as implied by subclause 5.2.1 regardless of the locale 
specified.
<BR>
Do the characters <TT><B>'a'</B></TT> through <TT><B>'z'</B></TT>, and <TT><B>'A'</B></TT> through 
<TT><B>'Z'</B></TT>, have to be classified as ``lower case'' and ``upper 
case,'' respectively, in every locale?
<BR>
Answer: Yes, the characters <TT><B>'a'</B></TT> through <TT><B>'z'</B></TT>, and <TT><B>'A'</B></TT> 
through <TT><B>'Z'</B></TT>, have to be classified as ``lower case'' and 
``upper case,'' respectively, in every locale (following the 
citations above).
