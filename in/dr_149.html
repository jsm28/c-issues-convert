declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>

<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 033: The term "variable"
<BR>
<I>[BSI characterize this issue as minor.]</I>
<BR> The term "variable" is used in subclause 7.7.1.1, but is never 
defined in the C Standard.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</B>
<BR> In subclause 7.7.1.1, change:
<BR> ... or refers to any object with static storage duration other 
than by assigning a value to a static storage duration variable of  type
<TT><B>volatile sig_atomic_t</B></TT>.
<BR> to:
<BR> ... or refers to any object with static storage duration other 
than by assigning a value to an object declared as <TT><B>volatile
sig_atomic_t</B></TT>.
<BR> Response
<BR> The next revision of the C Standard will use the term "object" 
instead of "variable" uniformly.<BR>
