     <b>Version:</b> 1.1<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2006-03-05<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> Clarifying trigraph substitution</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b></p>

    <p>Obviously, "before any other processing" is already implied
    by the phases of translation, but it doesn't hurt to point out
    the implication here. And in general, a distributive
    description ("each" with singular) tends to be less ambiguous
    than a collective one ("all" with plural). The motivation for
    deleting the phrase "in a source file" is, as far as I can see,
    weak at best.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change 5.2.1.1p1:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strike>All occurrences in a source file</strike>
      <u>Before any other processing takes place, each occurrence
      of one</u> of the following sequences of three characters
      (called <dfn>trigraph sequences</dfn><sup>12)</sup>)
      <strike>are</strike> <u>is</u> replaced with the
      corresponding single character.</p>
