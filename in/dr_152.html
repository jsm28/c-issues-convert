<B>Question</B>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report was prepared with considerable help from Mark 
Brader, Clive Feather, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose employment 
conditions require anonymity.</I>
<BR> DIN-003:
<BR> Can <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT> be used to return from a signal
handler invoked  other than through <TT><B>abort</B></TT> or <TT><B>raise</B></TT>?
The descriptions of 
<TT><B>signal</B></TT> and <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT> contradict each
other.
<BR> According to subclause 7.7.1.1 <B>The <TT>signal</TT> function</B>:
<BR> If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the 
<TT><B>abort</B></TT> or <TT><B>raise</B></TT> function, the
behavior is undefined if  the signal handler calls any function in the
standard library other  than the <TT><B>signal</B></TT> function
itself (with a first argument of the  signal number corresponding to the
signal that caused the invocation  of the handler) or refers to any
object with static storage duration  other than by assigning a value to
a static storage duration variable  of type <TT><B>volatile
sig_atomic_t</B></TT>.
<BR> Since <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT> is a function, it cannot be
called.
<BR> But subclause 7.6.2.1 <B>The <TT>longjmp</TT> function</B>,
broadly guarantees  the opposite:
<BR> As it bypasses the usual function call and return mechanisms,  the
<TT><B>longjmp</B></TT> function shall execute correctly in contexts
of  interrupts, signals and any of their associated functions.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</B>
<BR> If the intent is to allow calls to <TT><B>exit</B></TT> and <TT><B>
longjmp</B></TT> from  signal handlers not invoked through calls to <TT><B>
raise</B></TT> or <TT><B>abort</B></TT>,  replace in subclause
7.6.2.1:
<BR> ... other than the <TT><B>signal</B></TT> function itself ...
<BR> by:
<BR> ... other than <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT>, <TT><B>exit</B></TT>,
or the <TT><B>signal</B></TT>  function itself ...
<BR> Alternatively, if the intent is to disallow calls to <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT>
 from signal handlers not invoked through calls to <TT><B>raise</B></TT>
or <TT><B>abort</B></TT>,  replace in subclause 7.7.1.1:
<BR> As it bypasses the usual function call and return mechanisms,  the
<TT><B>longjmp</B></TT> function shall execute correctly in contexts
of  interrupts, signals and any of their associated functions.  However,
 if the <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT> function is invoked from a nested
signal handler  (that is, from a function invoked as a result of a
signal raised during  the handling of another signal), the behavior is
undefined.
<BR> by:
<BR> If the <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT> function is invoked from a nested
signal  handler (that is, from a function invoked as a result of a
signal  raised during the handling of another signal), the behavior is
undefined.
<BR> Response
<BR> The C Standard is clear enough as is. The <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT>
function shall  execute correctly when called from a non-nested signal
handler invoked  through calls to the <TT><B>raise</B></TT> or <TT><B>
abort</B></TT> functions; if <TT><B>longjmp</B></TT>  is called from a
signal handler invoked by other means, or from a  nested signal handler,
the behavior is undefined.<BR>
