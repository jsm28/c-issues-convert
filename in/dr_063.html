<B>Question</B>
<BR>
[This is Defect Report #056, resubmitted for administrative reasons.]
<BR>
The following requirement is implied in several places, but not explicitly 
stated. It should be explicitly affirmed, or alternative wording adopted.
<BR>
The representation of floating-point values (such as floating-point 
constants, the results of floating-point expressions, and floating-point 
values returned by library functions) shall be accurate to one unit 
in the last position, as defined in the implementation's <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> 
header.
<BR>
Discussion: The values in <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> aren't required to document 
the underlying bitwise representations. If you want to know how many 
bits, or bytes, a floating-point values occupies, use <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT>. 
The <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> values document the mathematical properties of 
the representation, the behaviors that the programmer can count upon 
in analyzing algorithms.
<BR>
It is a quality-of-implementation question as to whether the implementation 
delivers accurate bits throughout the bitwise representation, or alternatively, 
delivers considerably less accuracy. The point being clarified is 
that <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> documents the delivered precision, not the theoretically 
possible precision.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The C Standard imposes no requirement on the accuracy of floating-point 
arithmetic.
<BR>
Further discussion:
<BR>
The C Standard speaks directly to the matter of floating-point accuracy 
only in one or two areas. Subclause 6.2.1.4 <B>Floating types</B>, 
page 35, says of conversions from one floating type to one with less 
range and/or precision:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the value being converted is in the range of values that 
can be represented but cannot be represented exactly, the result is 
either the nearest higher or nearest lower value, chosen in an implementation-defined 
manner.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
And in subclause 6.2.1.5 <B>Usual arithmetic conversions</B>, page 
35:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The values of floating operands and of the results of floating 
expressions may be represented in greater precision and range than 
that required by the type; the types are not changed thereby.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Otherwise, arithmetic for both integer and floating types is defined 
in terms of the usual terminology of mathematics. Nothing in the C 
Standard suggests that floating arithmetic is excused from the conventional 
rules of arithmetic.
<BR>
Nevertheless, it is commonplace for the functions declared in <TT><B>&lt;math.h></B></TT> 
to deliver results less accurate than the underlying representation 
can support. It is not uncommon even for simple arithmetic expressions 
to do the same. And still, implementations document in <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT> 
properties of the underlying <I>representation,</I> not the effective 
range and precision reliably delivered. The C community has typically 
tolerated a certain laxity in this area.
<BR>
Probably the most useful response would be to amend the C Standard 
by adding two requirements on implementations:
<BR>
<BR>Require that an implementation document the maximum errors it 
permits in arithmetic operations and in evaluating math functions. 
These should be expressed in terms of ``units in the least-significant 
position'' (ULP) or ``lost bits of precision.''
<BR>
<BR>Establish an upper bound for these errors that all implementations 
must adhere to.
<BR>
The state of the art, as the Committee understands it, is:
<BR>
<BR>correctly rounded results for arithmetic operations (no loss 
of precision)
<BR>
<BR>1 ULP for functions such as <TT><B>sqrt</B></TT>, <TT><B>sin</B></TT>, and <TT><B>cos</B></TT> 
(loss of 1 bit of precision)
<BR>
<BR>4-6 ULP (loss of 2-3 bits of precision) for other math functions. 
<BR>
<BR>
 Since not all commercially viable machines and implementations 
meet these exacting requirements, the C Standard should be somewhat 
more liberal.
<BR>
The Committee would, however, suggest a requirement no more liberal 
than a loss of 3 bits of precision, out of kindness to users. An implementation 
with worse performance can always conform by providing a more conservative 
version of <TT><B>&lt;float.h></B></TT>, even if that is not a desirable approach 
in the general case.
<BR>
The Committee should revisit this issue during the revision of the 
C Standard.
