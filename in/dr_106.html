<B>Question</B>
<BR>
ANSI/ISO C Defect report #rfg13:
<BR>
Subclause 6.2.2.2 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The (nonexistent) value of a <I>void expression</I> (an expression 
that has type <TT><B>void</B></TT>) shall not be used in any way, ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
There are two separate (but related) problems with this rule.
<BR>
First, it is not entirely clear what constitutes a ``use'' of 
a value (or of an expression). In which lines of the following code 
is a type <TT><B>void</B></TT> value actually ``used?''
<BR>
<TT><B>void example(void *pv, int i)<BR>
	{<BR>
	&*pv;            /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	*pv;             /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	i ? *pv : *pv;   /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	*pv, *pv;        /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
(The answer to this question will determine which of the above lines 
cause undefined behavior, and which cause well defined behavior.)
<BR>
If one or more of the (questionable) lines from the above example 
are judged by the Committee to result in well defined behavior, then 
a second (separate) issue arises. This second issue requires some 
explaining.
<BR>
Subclause 6.2.2.1 contains the following rules:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An <I>lvalue</I> is an expression (with an object type
or an incomplete type other than <TT><B>void</B></TT>) ...
<BR>
Except when it is the operand of the <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> operator, 
the unary <TT><B>&</B></TT> operator, the <TT><B>++</B></TT> operator, the <TT><B>--</B></TT> operator, 
or the left operand of the <TT><B>.</B></TT> operator or an assignment operator, 
an lvalue that does not have array type is converted to the value 
stored in the designated object (and is no longer an lvalue)... If 
the lvalue has an incomplete  type and does not have array type, the 
behavior is undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that the final rule (specifying a condition under which undefined 
behavior arises) seems, based upon the context, to only apply to those 
cases in which ``...an lvalue that does not have an array type 
is converted to the value...'' More specifically, it appears that 
undefined behavior is <I>not</I> necessarily produced for non-lvalue 
expressions (appearing in the indicated contexts).
<BR>
Furthermore, it should be noted that the definition of an lvalue (quoted 
above) <I>does not include</I> all void types. Rather, it only includes 
<I>the</I> <TT><B>void</B></TT> type.
<BR>
The result is that the indicated lines in following example would 
seem to yield well defined behavior (or at least they <I>will</I> 
yield well defined behavior if the Committee decides that their unqualified 
counterparts do), however I suspect that this may not have been what 
the Committee intended.
<BR>
<TT><B>void example(const void *pcv, volatile void *pvv, int i)<BR>
	{<BR>
	&*pcv;              /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	*pcv;               /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	i ? *pcv : *pcv;    /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	*pcv, *pcv;         /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
<BR>
	&*pvv;              /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	*pvv;               /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	i ? *pvv : *pvv;    /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	*pvv, *pvv;         /*</B><I> ? </I><B>*/<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
In summary, I would ask that the Committee comment upon and/or clarify 
the behavior produced by each of the examples shown herein. Separately, 
I would request that the Committee make changes in the existing C 
Standard in order to make the rules applicable to such cases more 
readily apparent.

<B>Response</B>
<BR>
In the first function called <TT><B>example</B></TT>, the expression
statement <TT><B>&*pv</B></TT> is dealt with in <A HREF="dr_012.html">Defect Report #012</A>.
The remaining three statements are well formed. See the last
sentence of the cited reference and also subclause 6.6.3.
<BR>
In the second function called <TT><B>example</B></TT>, the expression
statements <TT><B>&*pcv</B></TT> and <TT><B>&*pvv</B></TT> are
dealt with in <A HREF="dr_012.html">Defect Report #012</A>. The remaining six statements
are well formed. The restrictions given in subclause 6.5.3 apply
to object types, not incomplete types.
