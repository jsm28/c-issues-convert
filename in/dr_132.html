<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Can undefined behavior occur at translation time, or only at run time? 
If the former, then how does one distinguish the two cases in the 
C Standard?
<BR>
Consider the translation unit:
<BR>
<TT><B>/*</B><I> No headers included </I><B>*/<BR>
int checkup()<BR>
	{<BR>
	/*</B><I> Case 1 </I><B>*/<BR>
	if (0)<BR>
		printf("Printing.\n");<BR>
	/*</B><I> Case 2 </I><B>*/<BR>
	return 2 || 1 / 0;<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
Case 1 calls a function with a variable number of arguments without 
a prototype in scope. But the call is never actually executed. Now, 
subclause 6.3.2.2, in the first paragraph of page 41, states that 
this is undefined. Is it undefined to <I>translate</I> the code, or 
to <I>execute</I> it? The definition of undefined behavior (subclause 
3.16) clearly allows the former, and subclause 5.3.2.2 does <I>not</I> 
say that the undefined behavior occurs only if the call is actually 
executed.
<BR>
On the other hand, while subclause 6.3.5 uses similar wording about 
division by zero, ``we all know'' that my Case 2 is strictly 
conforming.
<BR>
So what is the answer? If undefined behavior cannot occur at translation 
time, why the wording in subclause 3.16? If it can, how do I distinguish 
the possibilities? And, by the way, what is the answer for my Case 
1?

The Response to <A HREF="dr_019.html">Defect Report #109</A> addresses this issue. The translation 
unit must be successfully translated.
