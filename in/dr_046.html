<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
In subclause 6.7.1, page 82, line 9, it says, ``An identifier declared 
as a typedef name shall not be redeclared as a parameter.''
<BR>
The question I have is: Does that sentence stand by itself absolutely 
or is it intended to be read in the context of the paragraph in which 
it appears?
<BR>
The beginning of the paragraph says, ``If the declarator includes 
an identifier list, ...'' Function declarators including a parameter 
type list are dealt with in the preceding paragraph which says nothing 
about typedef names.
<BR>
In other words, is the following valid Standard C?
<BR>
<TT><B>typedef int foo;<BR>
int bar(int foo) {return foo; }
</B></TT><BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The sentence is a part of the paragraph in which it appears. An identifier 
declared as a typedef name may be redeclared as a parameter in a parameter 
type list. The example is strictly conforming.
