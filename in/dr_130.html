<B>Question</B>
<BR>
Under subclause 7.9.2 <B>Streams</B>, page 125, lines 26-28:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Data read in from a text stream will necessarily compare equal 
to the data that were earlier written out to the stream only if: the 
data consist only of printable characters and the control characters 
horizontal tab and new-line; ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Writing on a text stream might not cause characters to be overwritten 
exactly one for one, especially on fixed-length record based file 
systems. If the file is not truncated beyond the point where the data 
is written, there is no sure way to predict what will be read in after 
writing in the middle of a text stream because the data might just 
replace a character, a line, etc. Consider the following example:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdio.h><BR>
#include &lt;string.h><BR>
int buf[99];<BR>
unsigned int len;<BR>
int main()<BR>
	{<BR>
	FILE *f = fopen("test data", "w");<BR>
	fwrite("abc\ndef\n", 8, 1, f);<BR>
	fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);<BR>
	fwrite("UWXYZ", 5, 1, f);<BR>
	fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);<BR>
	len = fread(buf, 1, 10, f);<BR>
	if (len == 8 && !memcmp(buf, "UWXYZef\n"))<BR>
		;	/*</B><I> Case 1: OK, acts like binary </I><B>*/<BR>
	else if (len == 5 && !memcmp(buf, "UWXYZ", 5))<BR>
		;	/*</B><I> Case 2: OK to truncate after write </I><B>*/<BR>
	else if (len > 5 && !memcmp(buf, "UWXYZ", 5))<BR>
		printf("len = %u, buf = %s\n", len, buf);<BR>
			/*</B><I> Case 3: Is this nonstandard? </I><B>*/<BR>
	else<BR>
		printf("This is obviously nonstandard.\n");<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
Can a conforming implemetation translate the above program and produce 
the following output (Case 3)?
<BR>
<TT><B>len = 9, buf = UWXYZdef
</B></TT><BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Yes, a conforming implementation may produce the ``Case 3'' 
output. However, there may be cases in some conforming implementations 
in addition to those shown in your example, so the printout ``obviously 
nonstandard'' may be inappropriate.
