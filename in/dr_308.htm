    <p><b>Summary</b></p>

    <p>I do not recall the specific motivation for adding this
    note, but it's certainly true, and it seems harmless.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that in the C++ standard, this text is an
    embedded non-normative note at the end of the description of
    phase 7 (parsing and semantic analysis). But the C standard
    does not have embedded notes, and the note is not actually
    specific to phase 7 (which talks principally about tokens,
    without even mentioning files). Adding the text to this
    footnote, which already points out an implication of the as-if
    rule for the phases of translation, would seem to be the ideal
    solution.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change footnote 5 (5.1.1.2p1):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Implementations shall behave as if these separate phases
      occur, even though many are typically folded together in
      practice. <u>Source files, translation units and translated
      translation units need not necessarily be stored as files,
      nor need there be any one-to-one correspondence between these
      entities and any external representation. The description is
      conceptual only, and does not specify any particular
      implementation.</u></p>
