<B>Question</B>
<BR>
<B>Short description of problem</B>
<BR> The C Standard contains conflicting words on whether <TT><B>f()</B></TT>
can  be considered a call to a function-like macro with one empty
argument.
<BR>
<B>Problem description</B>
<BR> There seems to be a problem with empty arguments in macro calls in
 the current C Standard. An example:
<BR>
<TT><B>#define foo()     A<BR> #define bar(B)  B<BR>
<BR> foo()           //</B><I> no arguments</I><B><BR> 
bar()           // </B><I>one empty</I>
argument?
</TT><BR> There seem to be two choices when there are no preprocessing
tokens  between the parentheses in a macro call: a single empty argument
or  no arguments. The call to <TT><B>bar</B></TT> is different.
According to some  the call violates a constraint. Others are of the
opinion that the  call to <TT><B>bar</B></TT> is undefined behavior
and that it can be seen as  a call with a single, empty argument.
<BR> Quotes from subclause 6.8.3 of the C Standard: fourth paragraph of<BR>
<B> Constraints:</B>
<BR> The number of arguments in an invocation of a function-like  macro
shall agree with the number of parameters in the macro definition,  and
there shall exist a <TT><B>)</B></TT> preprocessing token that
terminates  the invocation.
<BR> Last paragraph of semantics:
<BR> If (before argument substitution) any argument consists of no 
preprocessing tokens, the behavior is undefined.
<BR> Is the call to <TT><B>bar</B></TT> in the example a constraint
violation or  undefined behavior? The question seems to show an
ambiguity in the  C Standard.
<BR> The X3J11 archives contain several requests to allow empty macro
arguments  and refusals to do so. The refusals stated that the reasons
would  be included in the rationale, but the rationale is silent on this
 matter. Hearsay indicates that X3J11 decided to leave the issue of 
empty macro arguments open.
<BR>
<B>Solutions:</B>
<BR> There seem to be four ways to change the C Standard:
<BR> (1) Resolve the ambiguity by considering <TT><B>bar()</B></TT>
and <TT><B>foo()</B></TT>  calls with no parameters.
<BR> (2) Resolve the ambiguity by considering <TT><B>bar()</B></TT>
and <TT><B>foo()</B></TT>  calls with one empty parameter.
<BR> (3) Resolve the ambiguity by making the interpretation of the
empty  preprocessing token sequence context dependent and consider <TT><B>
bar()</B></TT>  a call with one empty parameter and <TT><B>foo()</B></TT>
a call without parameters.
<BR> (4) Leave the issue open by making clear that empty arguments are 
undefined behavior and that a call without preprocessing tokens between 
the parentheses to a function-like macro defined with one parameter 
does not violate a constraint.
<BR>
<B>Arguments for a choice:</B>
<BR>
<BR>Solution 2 causes a constraint violation in <TT><B>foo()</B></TT>
and  thus forbids calls to macros defined without parameters.
Argument-less  macros are often used in current C programs. Thus making
this change  would violate the first part of guiding principle 1 of the
C9X charter:  Existing code is important.
<BR>
<BR>Solution 4 allows compiler writers to choose between solution  1
and solution 3.
<BR>
<BR>Solutions 1 and 2 are in conflict with WG14/N418, the proposal  to
allow empty arguments in macro replacements.
<BR>
<BR>Solution 3 conflicts with our rule to "keep it simple"  and will
create confusion. The following example serves as an illustration.  A
user had a program in which he used a function-like macro without 
arguments. While doing an overhaul of the program he decided that  he
needed one argument and changed the function definition accordingly. 
When he edited his program to change the calls, he forgot one call.  His
program compiled, but showed strange behavior. After several hours  of
debugging he found the one call with the missing arguments and  was very
surprised that the compiler had not complained.
<BR>
<B>Proposal</B>
<BR> The arguments above led us to believe that to allow empty
arguments  to function-like macros would be bad from a software
engineering viewpoint  and cause confusion. Thus we propose to use
solution 1. This can be  done by inserting the following sentence from
the semantics section  of subclause 6.8.3 quoted above:
<BR> A call to a function-like macro without preprocessing tokens 
between the opening and closing parentheses is taken to be a call 
without arguments, not a call with a single empty argument.
<BR> Response
<BR> This was addressed in the response to <A HREF="dr_003.html#Question3">Defect Report #003,
question  3</A>, which asked essentially the same question. A diagnostic is
not  required.<BR>
