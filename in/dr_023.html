<H2>Defect Report #023</H2>

<B>Submission Date</B>: 10 Dec 92 <BR>
<B>Submittor</B>: WG14 <BR>
<B>Source</B>: X3J11/91-003 (Fred Tydeman) <BR>
<B>Question</B> 1 <BR>
Assuming that 99999 is larger than <B><TT>DBL_MAX_10_EXP</TT></B>, what
is the result of: <BR>
<B><TT>strtod(&quot;0.0e99999&quot;, &amp;ptr);</TT></B> <BR>
Is it 0.0, <B><TT>HUGE_VAL</TT></B>, or undefined? <BR>
Subclause 6.1.3.1 <B>Floating constants</B> on page 26, lines 30-32 says:
``The significand part is interpreted as a decimal rational number; the
digit sequence in the exponent part is interpreted as a decimal integer.
The exponent indicates the power of 10 by which the significand part is
to be scaled.'' In this case <B><TT>0.0e99999</TT></B> means 0.0 times
10 to the power 99999, or 0.0x10<SUP>99999</SUP>, which has a scaled value
of 0.0; therefore, return 0.0. <BR>
Subclause 7.10.1.4 <B>The <TT>strtod</TT> function</B> on page 151, lines
12-14 says: ``If the correct value is outside the range of representable
values, plus or minus <B><TT>HUGE_VAL</TT></B> is returned (according to
the sign of the value), and the value of the macro <B><TT>ERANGE</TT></B>
is stored in <B><TT>errno</TT></B>.'' Since the exponent (99999 in this
case) is larger than <B><TT>DBL_MAX_10_EXP</TT></B>, the value is outside
the range of representable values (overflow). Therefore, return <B><TT>HUGE_VAL</TT></B>.
<BR>
Subclause 5.2.4.2.2 <B>Characteristics of floating types &lt;<TT>float.h&gt;</TT></B>,
pages 14-16, describes the model that defines the floating-point types.
The number <B><TT>0.0e99999</TT></B>, as written, is not part of that model
(it cannot be represented since the exponent is larger than <I>e<SUB>max</SUB></I>).
From subclause 6.2.1.4 <B>Floating types</B> page 35, lines 11-13, ``...
if the value being converted is outside the range of values that can be
represented, the behavior is undefined.'' Therefore, since this number,
as written, has no representation, the behavior is undefined. <BR>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
According to our response to <A HREF="dr_025.html">Defect Report
#025, Question 1</A>, the result of <B><TT>strtod(&quot;0.0e99999&quot;,
&amp;ptr)</TT></B> is exactly representable, i.e., it lies within the range
of representable values. Therefore, by subclause 7.10.1.4, <B>Returns</B>,
the value zero shall be returned in this case, and <B><TT>errno</TT></B>
shall not be set. (This means that implementations have to test for the
special case of zero when creating floating-point representations from
characters.) <BR>
Note also that <B><TT>strtod(&quot;0.0e-99999&quot;, &amp;ptr)</TT></B>
is not a case of underflow, so <B><TT>errno</TT></B> shall not be set to
<B><TT>ERANGE</TT></B> in this case either. <BR>
