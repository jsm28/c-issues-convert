<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>

<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any

<BR> Defect Report UK 006: Null pointer conversions
<BR> The C Standard does not define semantics for the explicit
conversion  of null pointer constants and for the implicit conversion of
null  pointers.
<BR> Subclause 6.2.2.3 reads in part:
<BR> If a null pointer constant is assigned to or compared for equality
 to a pointer, the constant is converted to a pointer of that type. 
Such a pointer, called a null pointer, is guaranteed to compare unequal 
to a pointer to any object or function.
<BR> Two null pointers, converted through possibly different sequences 
of casts to pointer types, shall compare equal.
<BR> Given the definitions:
<BR>
<TT><B>void * p = 0;<BR> int  * i = 0;</B>
</TT><BR> does the standard guarantee that the expression <TT><B>p ==
i</B></TT> always  evaluates to 1? The last quoted sentence only covers
casts, and not  the implicit conversions of that comparison. Conversely,
do the expressions 
<TT><B>(int *)0</B></TT> or <TT><B>1 ? 0 : (int *)0</B></TT> yield
null pointers of type 
<TT><B>(int *)</B></TT>? The quoted text does not cover the case of a
null pointer  constant being converted other than by assignment or in a
test for  equality, yet expressions such as these are widely used.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum:</B>
<BR> In subclause 6.2.2.3, change:
<BLOCKQUOTE> Two null pointers, converted through possibly different sequences 
of casts to pointer types, shall compare equal.
</BLOCKQUOTE> to:
<BLOCKQUOTE> Conversion of a null pointer to another pointer type yields  a
null pointer of that type. Any two null pointers shall compare equal.
</BLOCKQUOTE> Alternatively, a common term could be introduced to more
conveniently  describe the various forms of pointer that cannot be
dereferenced.  In this case, replace the last two paragraphs of
subclause 6.2.2.3  with:
<BLOCKQUOTE>For each pointer type, there exist values which can participate 
in assignment and equality operations, but which cause undefined
behavior  if dereferenced. These are referred to as <I>undereferenceable.</I>
 An undereferenceable pointer compares unequal to any other value of 
the same pointer type. For each pointer type, one particular
undereferenceable  pointer value is called the <I>null pointer.</I>
[Footnote: Since  there is only one such value, all null pointers of the
same type compare  equal.]</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>An integral constant expression with the value 0, or such an 
expression cast to type <TT><B>void *</B></TT>, is called a <I>null
pointer  constant.</I> If a null pointer constant is assigned to or
compared  for equality with an object of pointer type, or cast to
pointer type,  then it is converted to the null pointer of that type.
Conversion  of a null pointer to another pointer type produces the null
pointer  of that type.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR> If the answer to
<A HREF="dr_155.html"> Defect Report #155 </A>is that <I>unique</I> means 
<I>different each time,</I> then replace the last two sentences  of
subclause 7.10.3 with:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE> If the size of the space requested is zero, an undereferenceable 
pointer is returned. It is implementation-defined whether this is 
always a null pointer or whether the implementation attempts to produce 
a value distinct from any other undereferenceable pointer. Any pointer 
value returned by an allocation can be passed to the free function;  if
the value is not a null pointer, it becomes indeterminate. [Footnote:  A
subsequent allocation may return a pointer value with the same bit 
pattern, but a strictly conforming program can't detect this.] The 
value of a pointer that refers to any part of a freed object is also 
indeterminate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Response</B>
<BR><BR>
Does the Standard guarantee that <TT><B>p == i</B></TT>?  Yes.
<BR><BR>
Does <TT><B>(int *) 0</B></TT> yield a null pointer of type <TT><B>int *</B></TT>? Yes.
<BR><BR>
Does <TT><B>1 ? 0 : (int *) 0</B></TT> yield a null pointer of type <TT><B>int *</B></TT>? Yes.
<BR><BR>
The intent of the part of Subclause 6.2.2.3 that you quote is to state that a null pointer results
 when a null pointer constant is converted to a pointer.  By singling out assignment and 
comparison, the Standard is misleadingly specific.  This should be clarified in the
Standard.

type is called a null pointer.  A null pointer is guaranteed

Conversion of a null pointer to another pointer type yields
a null pointer of that type.  Any two null pointers shall compare
