Item 1 - Null pointer constants
<BR>
Consider the following translation unit:
<BR>
<TT><B>char *f1 (int i, int *pi)<BR>
	{<BR>
	*pi = i;<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}<BR>
<BR>
char *f2 (int i, int *pi)<BR>
	{<BR>
	return (*pi = i, 0);<BR>
	}
<BR></B></TT>
In <TT><B>f1</B></TT>, the <TT><B>0</B></TT> is a null pointer constant (subclause 6.2.2.3). 
Since <TT><B>return</B></TT> acts as if by assignment (subclause 6.6.6.4) the 
function is strictly conforming.
<BR>
In <TT><B>f2</B></TT>, the <TT><B>0</B></TT> is a null pointer constant. However, a constant 
expression cannot contain a comma operator (subclause 6.4), and so 
the expression being returned is not a null pointer constant per se. 
Which of the following is the case?
<BR><OL>
<LI> The property of being a null pointer constant percolates upwards 
through an expression, and the function <TT><B>f2</B></TT> is strictly conforming.
<LI> The property of being a null pointer constant does not percolate 
upwards, and the expression being notionally assigned in the <TT><B>return</B></TT> 
statement, though of value zero, is not a null pointer constant but 
only of type <TT><B>int</B></TT>, thus violating a constraint (subclause 6.3.16.1).
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Function <TT><B>f2</B></TT> is not strictly conforming, because it violates 
a constraint for simple assignment (which applies to converting the 
type of the <TT><B>return</B></TT> expression), because the <TT><B>return</B></TT> expression 
is not a null pointer constant.
