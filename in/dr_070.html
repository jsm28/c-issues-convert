Item 7 - interchangeability of function arguments
<BR>
Consider the following program:
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdio.h><BR>
<BR>
void output (c)<BR>
	int c;<BR>
	{<BR>
	printf("C == %d\n", c);<BR>
	}<BR>
int main (void)<BR>
	{<BR>
	output(6);<BR>
	output(6U);<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
The constant <TT><B>6</B></TT> has type <TT><B>int</B></TT>, and <TT><B>6U</B></TT> has type <TT><B>unsigned 
int</B></TT> (subclause 6.1.3.2), and they have the same representation 
(subclause 6.1.2.5). Footnote 16, which is not a part of the C Standard, 
states that this implies that they are interchangable as arguments. 
However, <TT><B>int</B></TT> and <TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT> are not compatible types, 
and so subclause 6.3.2.2 makes the second call undefined.
<BR>
Is the program strictly conforming?
<BR>
Note that similar issues arise in connection with the other cases 
mentioned in Footnote 16 (function return values and union members).
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The program is not strictly conforming. Since many pre-existing programs 
assume that objects with the same representation are interchangeable 
in these contexts, the C Standard encourages implementors to allow 
such code to work, but does not require it.
