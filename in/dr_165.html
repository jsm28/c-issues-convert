<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 013: Tags and incomplete types
<BR> The wording of subclause 6.5.2.3 concerning tags is defective in a number of ways.
<BR>
<B>Part 1</B>
<BR> The first paragraph states that:
<BR> If this declaration of the tag is visible, a subsequent declaration  that uses the tag and that
 omits the bracketed list specifies the  declared structure, union, or enumerated type.
<BR> This neither handles the case of a type name (for example, in the 
operand of the <TT><B>sizeof</B></TT> operator), nor does it make it
clear whether  or not the rule applies within the braces of the first
declaration  (the tag is in scope from the open brace).
<BR> In other words, it fails to address either occurrence of <TT><B>struct  tag *</B></TT> in the 
following code:
<BR>
<TT><B>  {<BR>         struct tag { int i [sizeof (struct tag *)]; };<BR>
        int j [sizeof (struct tag *)];<BR> /* ... */<BR> 	}</B>
</TT>
<BR>
<B>Part 2</B>
<BR> The second paragraph does not adequately distinguish between type 
specifiers which refer to an incomplete type and those which refer  to a
type in an outer scope. For example, in the following code, it  fails to
indicate whether or not all the uses of the tag refer to  the same type:
<BR>
<TT><B>struct tag;<BR> struct tag *p;<BR>         {<BR>         struct
tag *q;<BR>         /*</B> <I>...</I><B> */<BR>         }<BR> 	struct tag { int
member; };</B>
</TT>
<BR>
<B>Part 3</B>
<BR> The handling of enumerated types before their content is defined
is  also unclear; this was covered to some extent in<A HREF="dr_013.html#Question5"> DR013Q5</A> and  subsequent  discussion on the WG14 mailing list.
<BR> For example, what is the status of the following code:
<BR>
<TT><B>enum tag { e = sizeof (enum tag ******) };</B>
</TT>
<BR>or of:
<BR>
<TT>enum tag { e0, e1, e2, e3 };<BR>         {<BR>         enum tag2
{ e4 = sizeof (enum tag); };<BR>         enum tag  { e5 = sizeof (enum
tag); };<BR> 	}
</TT>
<BR> If an enumeration tag cannot be used before the end of the list
defining its contents, a diagnostic ought to be required.
<BR>
<B>Part 4</B>
<BR> If the same tag is used in a type specifier with a contents list
twice  in the same scope, it is unclear whether or not a diagnostic is
required.  It could be argued that, since this is forbidden by the
semantics  in subclause 6.5.2.3, it is not excluded from the second
constraint  of subclause 6.5, and so a diagnostic is required by that
constraint.  However, this may be viewed as clutching at straws. An
explicit constraint  should be added.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR> Rather than making piecemeal changes to address each issue
separately,  the whole subclause should be rewritten. Footnote numbers
have been  chosen to match the present footnotes.
<BR>
<B>Constraints</B>
<BR> A specific type shall have its content defined at most once.
<BR> A type specifier of the form
<BR>
<TT>          <B>enum identifier</B>
</TT><BR> without an enumerator list shall only appear when the type it
 specifies is complete.
<BR>
<B>Semantics</B>
<BR> All declarations of structure, union, or enumerated types that 
have the same scope and use the same tag declare the same type. The 
type is incomplete [63] until the closing brace of the list defining 
the content, and complete thereafter. [Footnote 63: An incomplete  type
may only be used when the size of an object of that type is not 
needed.]
<BR> [Append the present wording, or see Defect Report CA-2-09 -
submitted  independently - for alternative wording.]
<BR> Two declarations of structure, union, or enumerated types which 
are in different scopes or use different tags declare distinct types. 
Each declaration of a structure, union, or enumerated type which does 
not include a tag declares a distinct type.
<BR> A type specifier of the form
<BR>
<TT> <B>         struct-or-union identifier    { struct-declaration-list }<BR>
                                 opt or</B> <BR>
</TT>
<TT>          <B>enum identifier    { enumerator-list }<BR>              
                  opt</B> <BR>
</TT><BR> declares a structure, union, or enumerated type. The list
defines  the <I>structure content, union content,</I> or <I>enumeration
content.</I>  If an identifier is provided [64], the type specifier also
declares  the identifier to be the tag of that type. [Footnote 64: If
there  is no identifier, the type can, within the translation unit, only
 be referred to by the declaration of which it is a part. Of course, 
when the declaration is of a typedef name, subsequent declarations  can
make use of that typedef name to declare objects having the specified 
structure, union, or enumerated type.]
<BR> A declaration of the form
<BR>
<TT>          <B>struct-or-union identifier ;</B>
</TT><BR> specifies a structure or union type and declares the
identifier  as the tag of that type [62]. [Footnote 62: A similar
construction  with <TT><B>enum</B></TT> does not exist.]
<BR> If a type specifier of the form
<BR>
<TT>          <B>struct-or-union identifier</B>
</TT><BR> occurs other than as part of one of the above constructions, 
and no other declaration of the identifier as a tag is visible, then  it
declares a structure or union type which is incomplete at this  point,
and declares the identifer as the tag of that type [62].
<BR> If a type specifier of the form
<BR>
<TT>       <B>   struct-or-union identifier</B>
</TT><BR> or
<BR>
<TT>          <B>enum identifier</B>
</TT><BR> occurs other than as part of one of the above constructions, 
and a declaration of the identifier as a tag is visible, then it
specifies  the same type as that other declaration, and does not
redeclare the  tag.
