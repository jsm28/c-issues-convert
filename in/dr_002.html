<BR> 
<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>  Subclause 6.8.3.2: Semantics of <TT><B>#</B></TT>
<BR>  A minor detail in the semantics is that it does not explicitly
state that a <TT><B>\</B></TT> character will be inserted before a
<TT><B>\</B></TT> c haracter that occurs within a macro actual
parameter, only when the <TT><B>\</B></TT> character occurs within a
string literal or character constant within the actual parameter.
<BR>  I can see that there is an argument concerning the systems where
<TT><B>\</B></TT> is a valid part of a path name and where <TT><B>#include</B></TT>
path names are desired to be built dynamically and then <TT><B>#</B></TT>ed.
<BR>  Would it not be better, however, to escape all <TT><B>\</B></TT>
within actual parameters and require either
<BR> <OL TYPE=a> <LI>that systems using <TT><B>\</B></TT> in path names
escape them within<TT><B>#include</B></TT> strings, or perhaps
<LI>that during macro processing of <TT><B>#include</B></TT> parameters the
<TT><B>#</B></TT> operator will not cause <TT><B>\</B></TT>
characters to be esc aped at all or will be implementation defined?<BR> 
</OL>
<P>This second case (b) is better, as strings for <TT><B>#include</B></TT>
directiv es are already a special case (no escape processing, etc.), so
should not the <TT><B>#</B></TT> operator also be special for <TT><B>#include</B></TT>
directives?</P>  
<B>Response</B>  <P> The Committee reasserts that the grammar and/or
semantics of preprocessing as they appear in the standard are as
intended.   We are attaching a copy of the previous response to this
item from David F. Prosser (Editor of the standard). The Committee
endorses the substance of this response, which follows:   The rules in
subclause 6.8.3.2 regarding <TT><B>\</B></TT> were discussed in the
Committee and the result is as intended. The Committee's charter was to
standardize prior art where such was clear, and the behavior of those C
preprocessing phases that allowed tokens such as <TT><B>\</B></TT>
left them alone, even when inserting them into strings. However, the
Committee also had license to fix or add to the language where it was
judged to be deficient. Since none of the existing stringizing
preprocessing phases correctly handled string literals and certain
character constants, the special rules for these were chosen.  Subclause
6.8.3's examples (page 92, lines  4-33) include a <TT><B>\</B></TT>
that is outside of a string literal or character constant. If the rules
were to be modified along the lines of your proposal, the intended
effect would not happen.   One of the main points in your argument is
that uncontained <TT><B>\</B></TT>s are only critical in path names
that use <TT><B>\</B></TT> as a special characte r, and that this is
only needed when <TT><B>#include</B></TT> filenames are constru cted
via macro replacement. I agree that the current rules do allow this sort
of use without too much trouble, but I don't see this as being a main
motivation for this feature. By default, the rules for stringizing were
that the original spelling of the invocation argument is placed into a
string literal. The only exceptions made to this were those that were
valid C tokens that could not be simply inserted between a pair of <TT><B>
"</B></TT>s. The rules for <TT><B>\</B></TT> and <TT><B>"</B></TT>
within string literals and character constants were derived from that
need only. Furthermore, a lone <TT><B>\</B></TT> is a preprocessing
token due to the ``some other character'' rule of the syntax from subclause 6.1. This
would be the only place where special constraints were placed on one of
this type of preprocessing token.</P>
<P>Finally, solution b) of your discussion involves context-dependent rules for the stringizing operation. While there is a
minor context dependency regarding macro replacement and the <TT><B>defined</B></TT>
unary operator on <TT><B>#if</B></TT> and <TT><B>#elif</B></TT> directive lines, this is the only context dependency in the whole set of
macro replacement rules. Moreover, this dependency is at the topmost
level only. Solution b) would require a flag noting whether the result
of the replacement was to be used within a <TT><B>#include</B></TT>
directive. Therefore, the same macro invocation would produce different
results at different invocations. (At the least, debugging and/or
testing of a tricky macroized <TT><B>#include</B></TT> directive would
be more difficult.)</P>
<P>In conclusion, to the best of my knowledge, the Committee wants
to keep the behavior here as currently described, and made this choice
intentionally.
