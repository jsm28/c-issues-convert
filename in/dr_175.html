<I>In this Defect Report, identifiers lexically identical to those 
declared in standard headers refer to the identifiers declared in  those
standard headers, whether or not the header is explicitly mentioned.</I>
<BR>
<I>This Defect Report has been prepared with considerable help from 
Mark Brader, Jutta Degener, Ronald Guilmette, and a person whose
employment  conditions require anonymity. However, except where stated,
opinions  expressed or implied should not be assumed to be those of any
person  other than myself.</I>
<BR> Defect Report UK 023: Correction to Technical Corrigendum 1
<BR> An example added by TC1 is wrong.
<BR> TC1 added the following example to subclause 7.9.6.2:
<BR> In:
<BR>
<TT>  <B>#include  stdio.h <BR>         /*</B> <I>.....</I><B> */<BR>         int d1,
d2, n1, n2, i;<BR> 	i = sscanf("123", "%d%n%n%d", &amp;d1, &amp;n1,
&amp;n2, &amp;d2);</B>
</TT><BR> the value 123 is assigned to <TT><B>d1</B></TT> and the
value 3 to <TT><B>n1</B></TT>.  Because <TT><B>%n</B></TT> can never
get an input failure the value of 3 is  also assigned to <TT><B>n2</B></TT>.
The value of <TT><B>d2</B></TT> is not affected.  The value 3 is
assigned to <TT><B>i</B></TT>.
<BR> This should set <TT><B>i</B></TT> to 1, not 3, as <TT><B>%n</B></TT>
does not affect the  returned assignment count.
<BR>
<B>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</B>
<BR> In the example, change:
<BR> The value 3 is assigned to <TT><B>i</B></TT>.
<BR> to:
<BR> The value 1 is assigned to <TT><B>i</B></TT>.
