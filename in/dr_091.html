Item 28 - multibyte encodings
<BR>
Does a locale with the following encoding of multibyte characters 
conform to the C Standard?
<BR>
<BR>The 99 characters of the basic execution character set have 
codes 1 to 99, in the order mentioned in subclause 5.2.1.1 (so <TT><B>'A' 
== 1</B></TT>, <TT><B>'a' == 27</B></TT>, <TT><B>'0' == 53</B></TT>, <TT><B>'!' == 63</B></TT>, <TT><B>'\n' 
== 99</B></TT>).
<BR>
<BR>The extended execution character set consists of 16,256 (127 <TT><B> 
*</B></TT> 128) two-byte characters.
For each two-byte character, the first 
byte is between 1 and 127 inclusive, and the second byte is between 
128 and 255 inclusive.
<BR>
Note that any sequence of bytes can unambiguously be broken into multibyte 
characters, but the basic characters are prefixes of other characters.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The hypothetical locale described does conform to the C Standard
because the specified encoding does not violate the requirements
imposed on multibyte characters by subclause 5.2.1.2. No additional
requirements are needed.
