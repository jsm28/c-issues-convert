<B>Question</B> 1 <BR>
Composite type <BR>
Rule for function parameter compatibility, subclause 6.7,1, page 82, lines
24-25: <BR>
<B><TT>void f(const int);<BR>
void f(int a)<BR>
{<BR>
a = 4;<BR>
} <BR>
</TT></B>In the above case what is the composite type of <B><TT>f</TT></B>?
The legality of the assignment to <B><TT>a</TT></B> depends on the answer.
<BR>
<B><TT>int f(int a[4]);<BR>
int f(int a[5]); <BR>
</TT></B>The parameters are compatible because they are converted to <I>pointer
to</I> ..., but what is the composite type? <BR>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
<B><TT>void f(const int);<BR>
void f(int a)<BR>
{<BR>
a = 4;<BR>
} <BR>
</TT></B>What is the composite type of <B><TT>f</TT></B>? <BR>
Answer: <B><TT>void f(int)</TT></B>. <A HREF="dr_013.html">Defect
Report #013, Question 1</A> describes the correct manner for constructing
the composite type. <BR>
Is the assignment valid? <BR>
Answer: Yes. The type of a parameter is independent of the composite type
of the function, so the assignment is valid (cf. subclause 6.7.1). <BR>
Another example: <BR>
<B><TT>int f(int a[4]);<BR>
int f(int a[5]); <BR>
</TT></B>The parameters are compatible because they are converted to <I>pointer
to ...</I>, but what is the composite type? <BR>
Answer: The response to the Defect Report mentioned above answers this
question as well. <BR>
<B>Question</B> 2 <BR>
Is an implementation that fails to equal (or exceed) the value of an environmental
limit conforming? Subclause 5.2.4 says that those in that subclause must
be equalled in a conforming implementation. There is no such wording for
the environmental limits in the Library (subclauses 7.9.2, 7.9.3, 7.9.4.4,
7.9.6.1, 7.10.2.1). <BR>
<B>Correction</B> <BR>
<B><I>Add to subclause G.2, page 203:</I></B> <BR>
- A call to a library function exceeds an <B>environmental limit</B> (7.9.2,
7.9.3, 7.9.4.4, 7.9.6.1, 7.10.2.1). <BR>
<B>Question</B> 3 <BR>
Is an ``environmental constraint'' a constraint? <BR>
In subclause 7.6.1.1, page 118, lines 22-30, we have a set of environmental
constraints on where <B><TT>setjmp</TT></B> may occur. <BR>
Does violating these rules require a constraint error to be flagged, or
is it undefined behavior? <BR>
Some examples: <BR>
<B><TT>i = setjmp(a);<BR>
if (setjmp(a) == i)<BR>
... <BR>
</TT>Response</B> <BR>
Must an implementation diagnose violations of environmental constraints?
<BR>
Answer: Diagnostics are not required for constraint violations in clause
7, since subclause 5.1.1.3 refers to a constraint as defined in clause
3, which applies to language elements only. <BR>
<B>Question</B> 4 <BR>
For the fragment <BR>
<B><TT>if (a**b||c++d)<BR>
; <BR>
</TT></B><A HREF="dr_017.html#Question39">Defect Report #017 Question 39</A>
states that this is lexed as: <BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
{<B><TT>if</TT></B>} {<B><TT>(</TT></B>} {<B><TT>a</TT></B>} {<B><TT>&lt;&lt;</TT></B>}

{<B><TT>d</TT></B>} {<B><TT>)</TT></B>} <BR>
The rationale for this interpretation was that the constraint in subclause
6.1.7, page 32, lines 33-34 disallowed a header name preprocessing token
anywhere except within a <B><TT>#include</TT></B>. Since the header name
preprocessing token could not exist it was not lexed as such. <BR>
It was pointed out that the ``longest possible token'' rule was not influenced
by rules elsewhere in the C Standard, i.e. <B><TT>i+++++j</TT></B> is lexed
as: <BR>
<LI>
{<B><TT>i</TT></B>} {<B><TT>++</TT></B>} {<B><TT>++</TT></B>} {<B><TT>+</TT></B>}
{<B><TT>j</TT></B>} <BR>
not as: <BR>
<LI>
{<B><TT>i</TT></B>} {<B><TT>++</TT></B>} {<B><TT>+</TT></B>} {<B><TT>++</TT></B>}
{<B><TT>j</TT></B>} 
<BR>
</OL>
Now (c) is a constraint violation by subclause 6.3.2.4, page 42, lines
38-39, the operand of the second <B><TT>++</TT></B> is not a modifiable
lvalue. But this constraint does not require that the input be re-lexed
to form the preprocessing tokens given in (d), which is conforming code.
<BR>
As the UK C Panel saw it, the first example should be lexed as given in
(b) and a diagnostic issued. Having violated a constraint, we are now into
undefined behavior. An implementation could define the behavior in this
circumstance to be a re-lex of the input to produce the preprocessing tokens
given in (a). <BR>
As far as the user was concerned, they would get the expected behavior
with the added value of a diagnostic being issued. <BR>
All those present felt that the interpretation was incorrect and recommended
that the UK ask the Committee to reconsider its decision. <BR>
To summarize, there is no ambiguity in the C Standard and the original
X3J11 interpretation is incorrect. <BR>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
Is a diagnostic required for an input such as <BR>
<B><TT>if (a**b||c++d) <BR>
</TT></B>because of a violation of the constraint specified in subclause
6.1.7, page 32, lines 33-34? <BR>
Answer: No. Our response to <A HREF="dr_017.html#Question39">Defect Report
#017 Question 39</A> addresses this issue. <BR>
<B>Question</B> 5 <BR>
In the constraint for subclause 6.5.2, page 59, lines 2-4: What does the
C Standard mean when it says ``set?'' <BR>
Does it mean that the construct: <BR>
<B><TT>int int i;</TT></B> <BR>
violates a constraint? <BR>
It has been suggested that this wording was left vague to allow such constructs
as <B><TT>long long</TT></B> (which is supported by some compilers) to
fall into the undefined behavior category. <BR>
Would the Committee clarify the situation with regard to duplicate type
specifiers? Do such constructs result in a constraint error or undefined
behavior? <BR>
The related case <B><TT>static static</TT></B> is explicitly ruled out
by the constraints in the previous subclause. <BR>
Additionally, <B><TT>volatile volatile</TT></B> is ruled out by the constraint
in subclause 6.5.3. <BR>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
Example: <BR>
<B><TT>int int i;</TT></B> <BR>
Must this be diagnosed? <BR>
Answer: Yes. It is allowed to rearrange the order of type specifiers within
a set, but not to duplicate them (cf. subclause 6.5.2). Thus <B><TT>int
int</TT></B> is a constraint violation. <BR>
<B>Question</B> 6 <BR>
The definition of the <B><TT>offsetof</TT></B> macro in subclause 7.1.6
does not cover all its possible occurrences: <BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
There are no restrictions on the structure being a completed type. <BR>
<B><TT>struct t1 {<BR>
char c;<BR>
short s;<BR>
int i[offsetof(struct t1, s)];<BR>
} <BR>
</TT></B>When discussing the use of incomplete types, recourse usually
has to be made to the rules relating to where an object of unknown size
may appear. <BR>
Would the Committee agree that there are not any rules prohibiting the
above construction? <BR>
<LI>
In this structure we are asked to find the offset of a field that has not
yet been encountered: <BR>
<B><TT>struct t2 {<BR>
char c;<BR>
union {<BR>
int i[offsetof(struct t2, s)];<BR>
short s;<BR>
} u;<BR>
}; <BR>
</TT></B>Would the Committee agree that there do not appear to be any rules
that make this construct illegal? <BR>
<LI>
The following structure has infinitely many ``solutions:'' <BR>
<B><TT>struct t3 {<BR>
char a[offsetof(struct t3, i)];<BR>
int i;<BR>
} <BR>
</TT></B>since <B><TT>char</TT></B> has size 1, any size of array will
be the same as the <B><TT>offsetof</TT></B> the field <B><TT>i</TT></B>.
<LI>
The following structure has no ``solutions:'' <BR>
<B><TT>struct t4 {<BR>
int a[offsetof(struct t3, i)];<BR>
int i;<BR>
} <BR>
int</TT></B> is always larger than 1. <BR></OL>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Example: <BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><TT>struct t1 {<BR>
char c;<BR>
short s;<BR>
int i[offsetof(struct t1, s)];<BR>
};</TT></B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
This is <I>not</I> a valid use of the <B><TT>offsetof</TT></B> macro. The
hypothetical <B><TT>static <I>type</I> t;</TT></B> declaration required
for <B><TT>offsetof</TT></B> (cf. subclause 7.1.6) could not have validly
appeared prior to the invocation of <B><TT>offsetof</TT></B> because the
type <B><TT>struct t1</TT></B> is incomplete (cf. subclause 6.7.2); therefore
the <B><TT>offsetof</TT></B> invocation is not strictly conforming. <BR>
<LI> The answer is the same as (a) above. In addition, the members mentioned
in these invocations are not in scope. <BR>
<LI> The answer is the same as (a) above. In addition, the members mentioned
in these invocations are not in scope. <BR>
<LI> The answer is the same as (a) above. In addition, the members mentioned
in these invocations are not in scope. <BR></OL>
<B>Question</B> 7 <BR>
<B><TT>sizeof</TT></B> various identifiers (subclause 7.1.6) <BR>
a) <BR>
<B><TT>void f(int c, char a[sizeof(c)]);</TT></B> <BR>
b) <BR>
<B><TT>int i;<BR>
struct {<BR>
int i;<BR>
char a[sizeof(i)];<BR>
}; <BR>
</TT></B>Now the argument to <B><TT>sizeof</TT></B> must be an expression
or a type. <BR>
In (a) is <B><TT>c</TT></B> an expression? I think not because: <BR>
expression -&gt; object -&gt; has storage in execution envrionment <BR>
and <B><TT>c</TT></B> does not have storage allocated to it. So (a) violates
a semantic ``shall'' and is undefined behavior. <BR>
Now in (b) the field <B><TT>i</TT></B> is obviously not an expression.
But is it visible? Like the outer <B><TT>i</TT></B>, it has file scope.
However, it is in a different namespace. There are no rules for namespace
resolution in the <B><TT>sizeof</TT></B> subclause. <BR>
So is (b) legal or undefined behavior? <BR>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
Example: <BR>
<B><TT>void f(int c, char a[sizeof(c)]);</TT></B> <BR>
The reference to <B><TT>c</TT></B> is an expression because the previosly
declared identifier designates a function parameter (cf. subclause 6.5.4.3),
which is an object (subclause 3.15), thus meeting the requirement in subclause
6.3.1. <BR>
<LI> Another example: <BR>
<B><TT>int i;<BR>
struct {<BR>
int i;<BR>
char a[sizeof(i)];<BR>
}; <BR>
</TT></B>In C, this is okay. Subclause 6.1.2.3, <B>Name spaces of identifiers</B>,
requires that <B><TT>i</TT></B> in the <B><TT>sizeof</TT></B> expression
refers to the external <B><TT>i</TT></B>, not the member. <BR>
<B>Question</B> 8 <BR>
Refer to subclause 6.1.2.5, page 22, lines 32-36: <BR>
<BR>
<LI> <TT><B>char c = 7; /*</B><I> implementation defined behavior, since 7 need
not<BR>
be a member of the basic execution character set</I><B> */ <BR>
</B></TT>
<LI> <TT><B>c = 'a'; /*</B><I> ok</I><B> */<BR>
c++; /*</B><I> implementation defined</I><B> */ <BR>
</B></TT>c) <BR>
<TT><B>c = '1'; /*</B><I> ok</I><B> */<BR>
c++; /* </B><I>ok?</I><B> */ <BR>
</B></TT>
It has been suggested that the above constructs are not implementation
defined. <BR>
Subclause 6.1.3.4, page 29, lines 30-33: <BR>
<LI> <TT><B>c = '\07'; /*</B><I> what is in the source/execution character set
is<BR>
given in subclause 5.2.1. Anything else is an extension.</I><B> */ <BR>
</B></TT>e) <BR>
<B><TT>c = '$'; <BR>
</TT></B>It has been suggested that characters may be added to the basic
source/execution character set without implementation defined behavior
being invoked. (I guess my position on this item can be deduced from the
text.) <BR>
</OL>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>Subclause 6.1.2.5 says ``An object declared as type <B><TT>char</TT></B>
is large enough to store any member of the basic execution character set...
If other quantities are stored in a <B><TT>char</TT></B> object, the behavior
is implementation-defined: the values are treated as either signed or nonnegative
integers.'' Consider this example: <BR>
<B><TT>char c = 7;</TT></B> <BR>
The assignment <B><TT>c = 7</TT></B> is not implementation-defined because,
from a reasonable reading of subclause 6.1.2.5, it is clear that the only
implementation-defined behavior here is the signedness of the value of
the <B><TT>char</TT></B> object. <BR>
<LI> Another example: <BR>
<B><TT>c = 'a';<BR>
c++;</TT></B> <BR>
The increment of <B><TT>c</TT></B> after assigning an <B><TT>'a'</TT></B>
to it is defined by the implementation because the numeric encoding of
<B><TT>'a'</TT></B> is defined by the implementation. If <B><TT>'a'</TT></B>
were equal to <B><TT>CHAR_MAX</TT></B>, the increment could even cause
an overflow (cf. subclause 5.2.1). <BR>
<LI> Another example: <BR>
<B><TT>c = '1';<BR>
c++;</TT></B> <BR>
The increment of <B><TT>c</TT></B> after assigning a <B><TT>'1'</TT></B>
to it is not implementation-defined because the characters <B><TT>'0'</TT></B>
through <B><TT>'9'</TT></B> are required to be a contiguous range (cf.
subclause 5.2.1). Thus, the result is <B><TT>'2'</TT></B>. <BR>
<LI> Another example: <BR>
<B><TT>c = '\07';</TT></B> <BR>
The value of the character constant <B><TT>'\07'</TT></B> is defined by
the C Standard (cf. subclause 6.1.3.4, page 29, line 10-13). The implementation-defined
behavior of some escape sequences, described on page 29, lines 30-33, is
clarified in the example on page 30, lines 8-14. <BR>
<LI>
Another example: <BR>
<B><TT>c = '$';</TT></B> <BR>
If <B><TT>$</TT></B> is in the execution character set, the value of <B><TT>'$'</TT></B>
is locale-specific and so must be defined by the implementation (cf. subclause
5.2.1). </OL>
<B>Question</B> 9 <BR>
re: UK request for interpretation cai027 (
<A HREF="dr_017.html#Question27">Defect Report #017 Question 27</A>)
<BR>
X3J11 refs: 90-056, 90-083 <BR>
It has been pointed out, and the UK C panel agreed at its last meeting,
that the request for interpretation was unnecessary. The C Standard was
clear and unambiguous as is. <BR>
To make matters worse, X3J11 appears to have given an interpretation that
is the opposite of what the C Standard says. <BR>
The UK would like to withrdaw this request for interpretation and ask the
Committee to reconsider its position. <BR>
<B>Response</B> <BR>
We reaffirm the previous interpretation. <BR>
