<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
Under subclause 7.9.5.4 <B>The <TT>freopen</TT> function</B>, the C Standard 
states on page 130, lines 24-29:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><B>freopen</B></TT> function opens the file whose name is the 
string pointed to by <TT><B>filename</B></TT> and associates the stream pointed 
to by <TT><B>stream</B></TT> with it. The <TT><B>mode</B></TT> argument is used just as 
in the <TT><B>fopen</B></TT> function.
<BR>
The <TT><B>freopen</B></TT> function first attempts to close any file 
that is associated with the specified stream. Failure to close the 
file successfully is ignored. The error and end-of-file indicators 
for the stream are cleared.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is not clear whether the following situations have defined behavior:
<BR><OL>
<LI> Calling <TT><B>freopen</B></TT> where <TT><B>stream</B></TT> points to uninitialized 
storage. For example:
<BR>
<TT><B>	{ FILE a, *b;<BR>
	b = freopen("c.d", "r", &a);<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
(It may not be possible to detect that the information contained 
within <TT><B>a</B></TT> is not valid when the close for <TT><B>freopen</B></TT> is attempted.)
<LI> Calling <TT><B>freopen</B></TT> where <TT><B>stream</B></TT> is associated with 
a previously closed file. (The storage pointed to by <TT><B>stream</B></TT> 
may have been deallocated.)
</OL>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
The behavior is undefined in both cases; case (2) is clear from subclause 
7.9.3 <B>Files</B>, page 126, lines 24-27, ``A file may be disassociated 
from a controlling stream by <I>closing</I> the file... The value 
of a pointer  to a <TT><B>FILE</B></TT> object is indeterminate after the associated 
file is closed (including the standard text streams).'' Also subclause 
7.9.3 <B>Files</B>, page 126, lines 2-3 and lines 37-39, ``A stream 
is associated with an external file... by <I>opening</I> a file, ... 
At program startup, three text streams are predefined and need not 
be opened explicitly...'' Also subclause 7.9.5.3 <B>The <TT>fopen</B></TT> 
<B>function</B>, and, similarly, subclause 7.9.5.4 <B>The <TT>freopen</B></TT> 
<B>function</B>: ``The ... function opens the file ... and associates 
a stream with it...'' Thus when subclause 7.9.5.4 says ``The 
<TT><B>freopen</B></TT> function ... associates the stream pointed to by <TT><B>stream</B></TT> 
with it,'' the intention is certainly that <TT><B>stream</B></TT> already 
points to a valid stream. Extending this to case (1), we observe that 
<TT><B>a</B></TT> (or <TT><B>&a</B></TT>) might not refer to a stream, since none has 
been ``associated'' by any means specified in the C Standard.
