     <b>Source:</b> Clive D.W. Feather &lt;clive@demon.net&gt;<br>
     <b>Version:</b> 1.1<br>
     <b>Date:</b> 2002-03-07<br>
     <b>Subject:</b> graphic characters</p>
    <b>Problem</b> 

    <p>The Standard uses the terms "printing character", "graphic
    character", and "nongraphic character". The first is discussed
    in 5.2.2#1 and defined formally in 7.4#3:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[#3] The term printing character refers to a member of a
      locale-specific set of characters, each of which occupies one
      printing position on a display device;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A "nongraphic character" is clearly a character which is not
    a graphic character, but "graphic character" is nowhere
    defined. It is used only in 5.2.1#3, which requires "the
    following 29 graphic characters" to be part of the basic
    character sets, while "nongraphic character" is used in 5.2.2#2
    and 6.4.4.4#8 when discussing the <tt><b>\a</b></tt>
    <tt><b>\b</b></tt> <tt><b>\f</b></tt> <tt><b>\n</b></tt>
    <tt><b>\r</b></tt> <tt><b>\t</b></tt> and <tt><b>\v</b></tt>
    escape sequences.</p>

    <p>The key questions are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Are the 29 enumerated graphic characters required to be
      printing characters ?</li>

      <li>Are <tt><b>isalnum()</b></tt> and
      <tt><b>isspace()</b></tt> required to be false for them
      ?</li>

      <li>Is <tt><b>ispunct()</b></tt> required to be true for them
      ?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In addition, given that the seven characters corresponding
    to the escape sequences above are required to be control
    characters (see 5.2.1#3):</p>

    <ol>
      <li value="4">Should "nongraphic character" be replaced by
      "control character" ?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I believe that the answers should be:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>yes</li>

      <li>yes;</li>

      <li>yes in the C locale, but not otherwise;</li>

      <li>yes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>However, it is not clear that these answers can be derived
    from the Standard (though if (1) and (2) are "yes", (3) must at
    least be "yes in the C locale").</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>To address (1): in 5.2.1#3, replace "29 graphic characters"
    with "29 printing characters".</p>

    <p>To address (4): in 5.2.2#2 and 6.4.4.4#8 replace
    "nongraphic" with "control".</p>

    <p>To address (2): append to 5.2.1#4:</p>

    <blockquote>
      A <i>graphical mark character</i> is one of the 29 other
      printing characters listed above.
    </blockquote>
    in 7.4.1.2#2, insert between the two sentences: 

    <blockquote>
      The <tt><b>isalpha</b></tt> function returns false for all
      graphical mark characters.
    </blockquote>
    and in 7.4.1.10#2, change "characters for which" to "characters
    which are not graphical mark characters and for which". 

    <p>Given the above changes, (3) can be derived from the
    modified Standard.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>The referenced sections in the standard only use the term
    "non-graphic character" in the context of backslash-escape
    sequences, for which the standard is clear enough, and no
    changes are needed.</p>
