     <b>Subject:</b> 6.10p2: Breaking up the very long sentence
    describing preprocessing directive</p>

    <p><b>Summary</b></p>

    <p>The sentence describing a preprocessing directive is
    fearsomely long.</p>

    <p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change 6.10p2:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A preprocessing directive consists of a sequence of
      preprocessing tokens <strike>that begins with</strike> <u>.
      The first token in the sequence is</u> a <code>#</code>
      preprocessing token that (at the start of translation phase
      4) is either the first character in the source file
      (optionally after white space containing no new-line
      characters) or that follows white space containing at least
      one new-line character<strike>, and is ended by the
      next</strike> <u>. The last token in the sequence is the
      first</u> new-line character <u>that follows the first token
      in the sequence</u>.<sup>140)</sup> A new-line character ends
      the preprocessing directive even if it occurs within what
      would otherwise be an invocation of a function-like
      macro.</p>

    <p><b>Committee Response</b></p>

    <p>TC2 (and specifically <a href="dr_250.htm">DR 250</a>)
    changed that sentence into a definition.</p>

    <p><b>Technical Corrigendum</b></p>

    <p>Change 6.10p2:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A <dfn>preprocessing directive</dfn> consists of a
      sequence of preprocessing tokens <strike>that begins
      with</strike> <u>that satisfies the following constraints.
