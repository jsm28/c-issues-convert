<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
The description of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> in subclause 7.11.2.1 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>void *memcpy(void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);</B></TT>
<BR>
The <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> function copies <TT><B>n</B></TT> characters from the 
object pointed to by <TT><B>s2</B></TT> to the object pointed to by <TT><B>s1</B></TT>. 
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior 
is undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The definition of the term <I>object</I> in subclause 3.14 is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>object</B> - A region of data storage in the execution 
environment, the contents of which can represent values. Except for 
bit-fields, objects are composed of contiguous sequences of one or 
more bytes, the number, order, and encoding of which are either explicitly 
specified or implementation-defined. When referenced, an object may 
be interpreted as having a particular type...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Are the objects in the description of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> the largest objects 
into which the arguments can be construed as pointing?
<BR>
In particular, is the behavior of the call of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> in Example 
1 defined:
<BR>
<TT><B>void f1(void) {<BR>
	extern char a[2][N];<BR>
	memcpy(a[1], a[0], N);<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
because the arguments point into the disjoint array objects, <TT><B>a[1]</B></TT> 
and <TT><B>a[0]</B></TT>? Or is the behavior undefined because the arguments 
both point into the same array object, <TT><B>a</B></TT>?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
From subclause 3.14, an object is ``a region of data storage ... 
Except for bit-fields, objects are composed of contiguous sequences 
of one or more bytes, the number, order, and encoding of which are 
either explicitly specified or implementation-defined ...'' From 
subclause 7.11.1, ``the header <TT><B>&lt;string.h></B></TT> declares one type 
and several functions, and defines one macro useful for manipulating 
arrays of character type and other objects treated as arrays of character 
type.'' ``Various methods are used for determining the lengths 
of the arrays...'' From subclause 7.11.2.1, description of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT>, 
``if copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior 
is undefined.'' Therefore, the ``objects'' referred to by 
subclause 7.11.2.1 are exactly the regions of data storage pointed 
to by the pointers and dynamically determined to be of <TT><B>N</B></TT> bytes 
in length (i.e. treated as an array of <TT><B>N</B></TT> elements of character 
type).
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> So, no, the objects are not ``the largest objects into which 
the arguments can be construed as pointing.''
<LI> In Example 1, the call to <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> has defined behavior.
<LI> The behavior is defined because the pointers point into different 
(non-overlapping) objects.
</OL>
<B>Question</B> 2
<BR>
For the purposes of the description of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT>, can a contiguous 
sequence of elements within an array be regarded as an object in its 
own right? If so, are the objects in the description of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> 
the smallest contiguous sequences of bytes that can be construed as 
the objects into which the arguments point?
<BR>
In Example 2:
<BR>
<TT><B>void f2(void) {<BR>
	extern char b[2*N];<BR>
	memcpy(b+N, b, N);<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
can each of the first and last half of array <TT><B>b</B></TT> be regarded as 
an object in its own right, so that the behavior of the call of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> 
is defined? (Although they are not declared as separate objects, each 
half does seem to satisfy the definition of object quoted above.) 
Or is the behavior undefined, since both arguments point into the 
same array object <TT><B>b</B></TT>?
<BR>
In Example 3:
<BR>
<TT><B>void f3(void) {<BR>
	void *p = malloc(2*N);	/*</B><I> Allocate an object.</I><B> */<BR>
	{<BR>
	char (*q)[N] = p;	/*</B><I> The object pointed to by p may<BR>
							be interpreted as having type<BR>
							(char [2][N]) when referenced<BR>
							through q.</I><B> */<BR>
	/*</B><I> ...</I><B> */<BR>
	memcpy(q[1], q[0], N);<BR>
	/* ... */<BR>
	}<BR>
	{<BR>
	char *r = p;		/* </B><I>The object pointed to by p may<BR>
							be interpreted as having type<BR>
							(char [2*N]) when referenced<BR>
							through r.</I><B> */<BR>
	/*</B><I> ...</I><B> */<BR>
	memcpy(r+N, r, N);<BR>
	/*</B><I> ... </I><B>*/<BR>
	}<BR>
}
</B></TT><BR>
the types of the objects are inferred from the pointers, and the underlying 
storage is dynamically allocated. Is the behavior of each call of 
<TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> defined?
<BR>
Since the relationship between the values of the arguments presented 
to <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> is the same in all the above calls, it seems reasonable 
to expect that either all these calls of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> give defined 
behavior, or none do. But which is it?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Yes, for <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT>, a contiguous sequence of elements within 
an array can be regarded as an object in its own right.
<LI> The objects are not the smallest contiguous sequence of bytes 
that can be construed; they are exactly the regions of data storage 
starting at the pointer and of <TT><B>N</B></TT> bytes in length.
<LI> Yes, the non-overlapping halves of array <TT><B>b</B></TT> can be regarded 
as objects in their own rights.
<LI> The behavior (in Example 2) is defined.
<LI> The definition of object is independent of the <I>method</I> 
of storage allocation. The array length is determined by ``various 
methods.'' So, yes, the behavior of each call of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> is 
well-defined.
<LI> All of the calls of <TT><B>memcpy</B></TT> (in Example 3) give defined 
behavior.
</OL>
<B>Question</B> 3
<BR>
Similar questions arise for the other library string handling functions 
that have undefined behavior when copying between overlapping objects. 
These include <TT><B>strcpy</B></TT>, <TT><B>strncpy</B></TT>, <TT><B>strcat</B></TT>, <TT><B>strncat</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>strxfrm</B></TT>, <TT><B>mbstowcs</B></TT>, <TT><B>wcstombs</B></TT>, <TT><B>strftime</B></TT>, <TT><B>vsprintf</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>sscanf</B></TT>, and <TT><B>sprintf</B></TT>. For these functions, however, the 
number of bytes referenced through each pointer depends, at least 
in part, upon the values stored in the bytes.
<BR>
Consider a library function for which the number of bytes accessed 
or modified is affected by the values of the bytes. Is the object 
associated with each of its pointer arguments the smallest contiguous 
sequence of bytes actually accessed or modified through that pointer?
<BR>
In Example 4:
<BR>
<TT><B>void f4(void) {<BR>
	extern char b[2*N];<BR>
	strcpy(b+N, b);<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
is the behavior defined if <TT><B>N >> strlen(b)</B></TT>?
<BR>
In Example 5:
<BR>
<TT><B>void f5(void) {<BR>
	extern char c[2*N];<BR>
	strcat(c+N, c);<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
is the behavior defined if both <TT><B>N >> strlen(c)</B></TT> and <TT><B>N >> strlen(c) 
+ strlen(c+N)</B></TT>?
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
Length is determined by ``various methods.'' For strings in 
which all elements are accessed, length is inferred by null-byte termination. 
For <TT><B>mbstowcs</B></TT>, <TT><B>wcstombs</B></TT>, <TT><B>strftime</B></TT>, <TT><B>vsprintf</B></TT>, 
<TT><B>sscanf</B></TT>, <TT><B>sprintf</B></TT> and all other similar functions, it was 
the intent of the C Standard that the rules in subclause 7.11.1 be 
applicable by extension (i.e., the objects and lengths are similarly 
dynamically determined). The behavior (in Examples 4 and 5) is defined.
