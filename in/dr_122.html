<BR>
ANSI/ISO C Defect Report #rfg29:
<BR>
Subject: Conversion/widening of bit-fields.
<BR>
Must the following program print <TT><B>1</B></TT> or <TT><B>0</B></TT>?
<BR>
<TT><B>#include &lt;stdio.h><BR>
 <BR>
struct S { unsigned bit:1; } object = { 1 };<BR>
 <BR>
int main ()<BR>
	{<BR>
	printf ("%d\n", ((object.bit - 2) &lt; 0));<BR>
	return 0;<BR>
	}
</B></TT><BR>
(At least one existing implementations prints <TT><B>1</B></TT>
while another prints <TT><B>0</B></TT>.)
<BR>
Background:
<BR>
Subclause 6.2.1.1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A <TT><B>char</B></TT>, a <TT><B>short int</B></TT>, or an <TT><B>int</B></TT> bit-field, 
or their signed or unsigned varieties, or an enumeration 
type, may be used in an expression wherever an <TT><B>int</B></TT> or <TT><B>unsigned 
int</B></TT> may be used. If an <TT><B>int</B></TT> can represent all values of the 
original type, the value is converted to an <TT><B>int</B></TT>; otherwise it 
is converted to an <TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The key phrase here is ``the original type.''
<BR>
In effect, I am asking if the <I>type</I> of a bit-field is totally 
independent from its <I>width</I> for the purposes of the above rule.
<BR>
If the answer to that question is ``yes,'' then the value of 
<TT><B>object.bit</B></TT> must be considered to be an <TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT> (with 
a value of <TT><B>1U</B></TT>). In that case, the value <TT><B>2</B></TT> used in the 
above example must also be converted to type <TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT> and 
then the subtraction should be carried out on the two <TT><B>unsigned 
int</B></TT> values. The subtraction should then itself yield a value of 
type <TT><B>unsigned int</B></TT> which is itself (by definition) >= 0, so it 
would seem that the C Standard requires
the above program to print <TT><B>0</B></TT>.
<BR>
Is that correct? If so, perhaps the wording of the above paragraph 
needs to be improved so as to make the correct interpretation of 
these rules more apparent to implementors.
<BR>
<B>Response</B>
<BR>
See <A HREF="dr_015.html">Defect Report #015</A>.
``The original type'' applies to both width and signedness.
<TT><B>object.bit</B></TT> promotes to <TT><B>int</B></TT>,
and the program prints <TT><B>1</B></TT>.
