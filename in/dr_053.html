<B>Question</B> 1
<BR>
There's been a discussion on <TT><B>comp.std.c</B></TT> recently about accessing 
a pointer to a function with parameter type information through a 
pointer to a pointer to a function without parameter type information. 
For example:
<BR>
<TT><B>int f(int);<BR>
	int (*fp1)(int);<BR>
	int (*fp2)();<BR>
	int (**fpp)();<BR>
<BR>
	fp1 = f;<BR>
	fp2 = fp1;	/*</B><I> pointers to compatible types, assignment ok </I><B>*/<BR>
	(*fp2)(3);	/*</B><I> function types are compatible, call is ok </I><B>*/<BR>
	fpp = &fp1;	/*</B><I> pointer to compatible types, assignment ok </I><B>*/<BR>
	(**fpp)(3);	/*</B><I> valid? </I><B>*/
</B></TT><BR>
The final call itself should be valid since the resulting function 
type is compatible with the type of the function being called, but 
there's still a problem: Subclause 6.3 <B>Expressions</B>, page 38, 
says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue 
expression that has one of the following types:<B>36</B>
<BR>
- the declared type of the object,
<BR>
- a qualified version of the declared type of the object,
<BR>
- a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding 
to the declared type of the object,
<BR>
- a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding 
to a qualified version of the declared type of the object,
<BR>
- an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned 
types among its members (including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate 
or contained union), or
<BR>
- a character type.
<BR>
[Footnote 36: The intent of this list is to specify those circumstances 
in which an object may or may not be aliased.]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This would appear to render the final call undefined since the stored 
value of <TT><B>fp1</B></TT> is being accessed by an lvalue that does not match 
its declared type: <TT><B>(int (*)())</B></TT> vs. <TT><B>(int (*)(int))</B></TT>.
<BR>
I think that this example should be valid and that the above limitation 
is too strict. I think what we meant to say was ``<I>a type compatible 
with</I> the declared type of the object,'' which would allow ``reasonable'' 
type mismatches without allowing aliasing between wildly different 
types.

<BR>
An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue expression 
that has one of the following types:<B>36</B>

<BR>

<BR>
<I><B>to:</B></I>
